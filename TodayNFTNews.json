[{"Content":"The Sandbox, a prominent player in the world of NFTs and virtual metaverse creation, has taken a significant stride towards enhancing accessibility and reducing costs for creators and users. The latest development sees the launch of The Sandbox Marketplace on Polygon, a move that promises to reshape the NFT landscape.\nOne of the most notable features of this launch is the ability for anyone to mint their digital assets (ASSETs) on the Polygon marketplace using CATALYSTs. This democratizes the NFT creation process, making it accessible to a broader audience. Notably, Polygon\u2019s network significantly reduces transaction fees, addressing a long-standing concern in the NFT space.\nFurthermore, The Sandbox introduces a secondary market, allowing NFT owners to resell ASSETs that they didn\u2019t originally create on the platform. This opens up new avenues for trading and monetizing digital collectibles.\nFor those already holding CATALYSTs, minting on the Polygon marketplace becomes readily accessible. But what if you don\u2019t have CATALYSTs yet? The Sandbox plans to distribute CATALYSTs to ecosystem contributors, including LAND owners, as part of their commitment to expanding opportunities for creators.\nExisting ASSET holders need not worry about the fate of their assets. Minted assets on the Ethereum chain will remain usable and can be bridged to the Polygon layer in the future. Non-minted assets, like equipment, will be migrated to align with the new structure, ensuring a smooth transition for users.\nGas fees have long been a concern for NFT enthusiasts, but The Sandbox addresses this by significantly reducing fees on the Polygon marketplace. Additionally, they cover a portion of Polygon transaction fees for users across their ecosystem, enhancing affordability.\nThe user interface of the marketplace has undergone a revamp, with improved asset upload flows, asset moderation, and an enhanced user experience. This ensures a seamless and efficient trading experience for users.\nTo buy your first NFT on Polygon via The Sandbox Marketplace, you need to log in, connect your wallet to the Polygon network, browse the marketplace, select your desired NFT, and complete the purchase. The process is streamlined, making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned collectors.\nAs The Sandbox expands its metaverse and NFT offerings, creators are encouraged to participate in VoxEdit contests and contribute to the vibrant community. The launch of the new marketplace also comes with a captivating collection from 30 talented artists, adding to the diversity of available ASSETs.\nThe Sandbox\u2019s move to launch its marketplace on Polygon opens up exciting opportunities for creators and collectors alike. With reduced fees, improved user experience, and a commitment to accessibility, it marks a significant step forward in the ever-evolving world of NFTs.\n","Image Url":"https://www.todaynftnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Polygon-Joins-Forces-with-The-Sandbox-for-Lower-Fee-NFT-Trading1-logo.png","Title":"Polygon Joins Forces with The Sandbox for Lower Fee NFT Trading","Author":"Jerry Christopher","Tag":"NFT market, Polygon, The Sandbox","Date":"DEC 15, 2023"},{"Content":"Japanese electronics giant Casio has made a bold move into the world of NFTs, offering a limited-edition collection of digital art collectibles featuring their iconic G-Shock brand of watches.

In a surprising move, the creators have decided to shut down the P2E and NFT features of the Game due to a growing problem of rampant cheating.\nThis move, announced on December 13, has left the gaming community in awe as Immortal Game was initially hailed as a pioneering platform aiming to provide players with a legitimate opportunity to earn income through chess. However, their noble intentions have backfired, leading to an influx of unfair practices and cheating within the Game.\nThe root of the problem is the large sums of cash rewards offered with no entry barriers, which inadvertently encouraged players to exploit the system. In their announcement, immortal Game\u2019s developers noted that this situation degraded the experience for genuine players who sought a fair and secure environment to enjoy online chess.\nStarting immediately, the marketplace for Immortal Game NFTs will be discontinued, and players will no longer be able to use the native P2E Checkmate token (CMT) within the Game. While NFTs will continue on the blockchain, users will no longer receive CMT rewards for participating in tournaments or daily challenges. Instead, fiat currency rewards may be introduced as an alternative.\nIn a further adjustment, users will no longer see their ETH and CMT balances displayed on the platform, although these tokens will remain in their wallets. Those using custodial wallets must connect a personal wallet to facilitate asset transfers.\nBefore its discontinuation, Immortal Game NFTs had amassed a lifetime trading volume of $885,600, while the CMT token boasted a fully diluted market capitalization of $360,075. These NFTs were minted on the Immutable blockchain, adding to the gaming landscape.\nThis decision by Immortal Game\u2019s developers marks a turning point in the P2E and NFT gaming industry, as it highlights the challenges and pitfalls associated with offering substantial financial incentives to players. It remains to be seen whether other projects in the space will follow suit or find innovative solutions to combat cheating while maintaining the allure of play-to-earn gaming.\n","Image Url":"https://www.todaynftnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Web3-Chess-Game-Developer-Discontinues-Play-to-Earn-Feature-Amidst-Rampant-Cheating1-logo.png","Title":"Web3 Chess Game Developer Discontinues Play-to-Earn Feature Amidst Rampant Cheating","Author":"Jerry Christopher","Tag":"Blockchain, NFT market, Web3","Date":"DEC 14, 2023"},{"Content":"Line Next, the NFT arm of the popular messaging app Line, has secured $140 million in funding as it gears up to launch a global NFT marketplace, DOSI, in January 2024.

At that time, he clarified that he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser to the company.\nIn his recent statement, Aronow revealed the unpredictable nature of his health journey, describing days when he feels ready to dive back into work and others when he feels the need for immediate medical attention.\nWhile he has been away, Aronow has been watching Yuga Labs\u2019 operations, responsible for popular NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks.

According to the FSC\u2019s notice, starting from July 2024, investors who deposit their digital assets into exchanges will be entitled to receive interest on their deposits. This move is part of South Korea\u2019s efforts to regulate the crypto space more comprehensively.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this new rule. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been excluded from the mandate. The FSC\u2019s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs reflects the unique nature of these digital assets, which may not fit the criteria for interest-bearing deposits.\nInterestingly, the FSC has left room for potential exceptions to this exclusion. If certain NFTs are categorized as payment methods and are issued in significant quantities, they may be reclassified as virtual assets and become eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. This shows the regulator\u2019s flexibility in adapting to the evolving landscape of digital assets.\nIn addition to addressing interest on deposits, the FSC has also laid out guidelines for the safe handling of user deposits by virtual asset operators. Exchanges are now required to segregate user deposits from their own assets and entrust them to a bank. Furthermore, a substantial portion, specifically 80%, of the coins must be stored in a secure cold wallet, enhancing security measures.\nThe FSC\u2019s directive also covers preparations for potential hacks or computer incidents. Virtual asset service providers are mandated to either acquire insurance or accumulate reserves to mitigate the impact of such incidents. Additionally, the new law prohibits exchanges from blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it is deemed absolutely necessary and authorized by the courts or financial regulators.\nSouth Korea has been actively solidifying its regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier in December, financial regulators called on users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges operating within the country. This initiative was led by the Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea.\nAs South Korea continues to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, these regulatory changes aim to strike a balance between investor protection and industry growth. The FSC\u2019s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs, while allowing for potential exceptions, highlights the need for flexible and nuanced regulation in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n","Image Url":"https://www.todaynftnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/South-Korea-Exempts-NFTs-and-CBDCs-from-Cryptocurrency-Interest-Mandate1-logo.png","Title":"South Korea Exempts NFTs and CBDCs from Cryptocurrency Interest Mandate","Author":"Jerry Christopher","Tag":"NFT market, South Korea","Date":"DEC 11, 2023"},{"Content":"In a compelling turn of events, the nonfungible token (NFT) market has experienced a robust surge in trading volume, approaching the $1 billion mark in November.

This discovery has prompted a swift response from Ethereum NFT marketplaces and creators, underscoring the urgency of securing digital assets.\nThe vulnerability, which remains undisclosed to prevent exploitation, affects pre-built contracts provided by Thirdweb and potentially others. Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized apps and NFT collections, making this a critical concern for stakeholders. OpenZeppelin, another prominent player in smart contract libraries, clarified that the problem does not originate from its repository. Despite this, the company has committed to leading the community in identifying affected parties and offering mitigation strategies.\nIMPORTANT\nOn November 20th, 2023 6pm PST, we became aware of a security vulnerability in a commonly used open-source library in the web3 industry.\nThis impacts a variety of smart contracts across the web3 ecosystem, including some of thirdweb\u2019s pre-built smart contracts.\u2026\n\u2014 thirdweb (@thirdweb) December 5, 2023\n\nIn a proactive measure, Thirdweb advises projects to lock down their current smart contracts and transition to new ones, ensuring the safety of their collections. The firm has also pledged to support affected parties financially by covering the network fees for this migration. This recommendation comes after Thirdweb implemented a fix to its smart contract templates on November 22, ensuring that contracts deployed after this date are secure.\nThe exploit impacts NFT smart contracts adhering to Ethereum\u2019s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and ERC-20 standard fungible tokens. Thirdweb\u2019s blog post provides a detailed list of affected contract types and a tool for identifying compromised contracts.\nSeveral major industry players have weighed in on the situation. OpenSea and Rarible, leading NFT marketplaces, are exploring ways to assist collection owners with contract migrations. Coinbase revealed that some collections on its NFT platform are affected, while Manifold, a smart contract startup, confirmed its contracts are safe. Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network, acknowledged the impact on some project contracts but assured the network\u2019s security.\nEthereum profile picture project Cool Cats and Animoca Brands\u2019 Mocaverse gaming platform are moving to new contracts to safeguard their NFT collections. In response to the challenge, Thirdweb has doubled its bug bounty payments to $50,000 and committed to a more stringent auditing process in the future. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in the rapidly evolving field of NFTs and the importance of robust security measures to protect digital assets in the decentralized space.\n","Image Url":"https://www.todaynftnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Ethereum-NFT-Developers-Rush-to-Safeguard-Projects-Against-Thirdweb-Security-Flaw1-logo.png","Title":"Ethereum NFT Developers Rush to Safeguard Projects Against Thirdweb Security Flaw","Author":"Jerry Christopher","Tag":"Ethereum, NFT market","Date":"DEC 06, 2023"},{"Content":"In a significant move, Tiger Global, a prominent investment firm, has drastically reduced its investments in notable non-fungible token (NFT) projects. These investments include the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection and the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Bloomberg\u2019s recent report reveals that Tiger Global slashed its BAYC stakes by 69% and OpenSea holdings by 94%. Moreover, the firm has also cut valuations for several other portfolio companies.\nTiger Global\u2019s decision reflects a cautious approach towards the volatile crypto market. The firm has been diversifying its investments in the crypto realm, focusing on NFTs and blockchain security and privacy-focused initiatives. In 2021, it co-led a $24 million funding round for blockchain security company CertiK, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing decentralized finance (DeFi) security.\nFurthermore, in 2022, Tiger Global participated in a Series B investment for Aleo, a zero-knowledge applications platform, which successfully raised $200 million. This round saw leading investors like Kora Management LP and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Additionally, the firm invested in Polygon, a layer-2 network, showcasing its broad interest in crypto.\nHowever, Tiger Global is not alone in this cautious stance. Coatue Management, another major player and co-lead investor in OpenSea, recently marked down its investment in the NFT marketplace by 90%. This reduction brought OpenSea\u2019s valuation down to $1.4 billion, a significant decrease from its previous valuation.\nThese markdowns by Tiger Global and Coatue Management signal a broader trend of reevaluation within the NFT market. Investors are becoming more circumspect, primarily due to fluctuating market values. Consequently, this shift could lead to more conservative investment strategies in the NFT and broader crypto sectors.\nBesides these adjustments, these investment giants\u2019 moves underscore the NFT space\u2019s evolving nature. Hence, as the market matures, further recalibrations in investments are likely. These developments may pave the way for more stable and sustainable growth in the crypto and NFT sectors in the long run.\n","Image Url":"https://www.todaynftnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tiger-Global-Coatue-Management-Cut-NFT-Investments-Amid-Market-Volatility1-logo.png","Title":"Tiger Global & Coatue Management Cut NFT Investments Amid Market Volatility","Author":"Jerry Christopher","Tag":"NFT market","Date":"DEC 02, 2023"},{"Content":"In a significant development within the NFT industry, Adam Weitsman acquired Gold Mega Koda #9969, as shared in a recent announcement.
