    "hashtag": "Blockchain, NFT market",
    "content": "The digital landscape of blockchain technology recently experienced a seismic shift, particularly in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem, where a significant uptick in transaction fees was observed. This phenomenon, largely driven by the rapidly growing interest in EVM inscriptions, marked a notable milestone in blockchain activity over the past weekend.\nThe rise in EVM chain activities led to a record-breaking increase in gas fees, with figures reaching a new zenith. According to the latest insights from Dune Analytics, the cost of inscriptions escalated to a staggering $8.3 million on December 16. Among the networks, Avalanche witnessed the heftiest gas expenses, accounting for more than $5.6 million that day. Not far behind, Arbitrum One recorded around $2.1 million in gas fees due to inscription activities. \nThis trend transcended the Ethereum ecosystem, impacting the Bitcoin network as well. The surge in Bitcoin inscriptions led to a significant demand for block space, resulting in an extensive queue of almost 280,000 unconfirmed transactions. The heightened activity pushed Bitcoin transaction fees to a peak of $37, presenting a challenge for smaller, peer-to-peer transactions on the network.\n\nThe heightened inscription activity has been challenging. For instance, the Arbitrum One network grappled with a 78-minute outage on December 15, highlighting the stress these activities can place on blockchain infrastructures.\nAmid these developments, EVM inscriptions are gaining traction, similar to the Ordinals on the Bitcoin network. These inscriptions involve embedding unique information within transaction call data to create distinct, on-chain, nonfungible tokens (NFTs). The interest in this area is palpable, evidenced by the Bitcoin Frogs Ordinals collection’s market capitalization soaring to $182 million.\nIndustry veterans, including Bitcoin pioneer Adam Back, view these developments as a vital push towards innovation in blockchain technologies, especially in layer-2 solutions. This sentiment is mirrored within the blockchain community, with enthusiasts and developers exploring new applications and capabilities of these platforms.\nThe recent events in the blockchain sector underscore a pivotal evolution, with EVM inscriptions at the forefront. This movement highlights the escalating fascination with NFTs and digital collectibles and emphasizes the necessity for scalable and robust network solutions to cater to the increasing demand. As blockchain technology evolves, it paves the way for the next chapter of digital innovation and exploration.\n"

    "content": "In a striking turn of events, the NFT community witnessed a remarkable recovery of stolen digital assets. Recently, hackers infiltrated NFT Trader, a prominent peer-to-peer trading platform, pilfering a significant collection of nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Among the spoils were 37 Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), 13 Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) tokens, and other valuable NFTs like VeeFriends and World of Women. Nearly $3 million theft left the digital art world in shock.\n\nHowever, the story took an unexpected twist. Boring Security, a Web3 security project, orchestrated a swift and effective response. They collaborated with Greg Solano, co-founder of Yuga Labs – the creator of BAYC and MAYC. Together, they strategised a resolution that involved a bounty payment. Their efforts bore fruit, and within 24 hours, all stolen NFTs were recovered. In exchange for the digital assets, the hackers received a 120 Ether (ETH) bounty, valued at approximately $267,000.\nThis operation’s success hinged on the swift action and collaborative spirit within the NFT community. The gesture by Solano to finance the bounty and the proactive approach by Boring Security underscored resilience and unity in the face of adversity. It vividly demonstrated the community’s determination to uphold Security and integrity in the burgeoning NFT space.\nMeanwhile, the incident exposed vulnerabilities in NFT trading platforms, prompting urgent calls for enhanced security measures. Users were advised to revoke permissions granted to two specific old contracts, identified as potential gateways for similar attacks. This precaution was crucial in preventing further unauthorized NFT transfers.\nThe NFT Trader team, aided by a developer known as Foobar, addressed the breach promptly. Their efforts highlighted the ongoing challenges and the need for continual vigilance in the dynamic world of digital asset trading. As the NFT market evolves, this incident serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security measures and the power of community collaboration in safeguarding valuable digital assets.\n"

Another image, a pixelated avocado titled “BIP39 SEED,” originally expected to sell for $20,000 to $30,000, stunned observers by selling for $101,600.\nThis auction was even more remarkable because over two-thirds of the bidders were new to the Sotheby’s platform, indicating a growing interest in NFTs on Bitcoin. This surge in popularity harkens back to the frenzy that engulfed digital-asset markets a couple of years ago when NFTs and digital artwork first started commanding eye-popping prices. Notably, one NFT by artist Beeple fetched an astonishing $69 million at Christie’s auction house. However, many of those NFT collections were built on the Ethereum blockchain, making Sotheby’s Bitcoin NFT auction a unique event.\nThe “BitcoinShrooms” collection is credited to the pseudonymous artist Shroomtoshi and is part of the Ordinals inscriptions, a technology Casey Rodarmor developed atop the Bitcoin blockchain late last year. These inscriptions have gained popularity, causing congestion and increased fees on the Bitcoin network.\nThe success of this auction raises an interesting debate within the Bitcoin community about whether to filter out transactions related to NFT-like inscriptions. Some argue that these inscriptions need to align with the original vision of Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment network. However, the perceived value of these digital images as high art could shift the balance in favour of profit interests.\nSotheby’s groundbreaking auction of NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain has demonstrated the mainstream appeal of these digital collectibles. With new bidders flocking to the platform and record-breaking sales, the intersection of art and cryptocurrency is evolving in exciting and unexpected ways.\n"

The latest development sees the launch of The Sandbox Marketplace on Polygon, a move that promises to reshape the NFT landscape.\nOne of the most notable features of this launch is the ability for anyone to mint their digital assets (ASSETs) on the Polygon marketplace using CATALYSTs. This democratizes the NFT creation process, making it accessible to a broader audience. Notably, Polygon’s network significantly reduces transaction fees, addressing a long-standing concern in the NFT space.\nFurthermore, The Sandbox introduces a secondary market, allowing NFT owners to resell ASSETs that they didn’t originally create on the platform. This opens up new avenues for trading and monetizing digital collectibles.\nFor those already holding CATALYSTs, minting on the Polygon marketplace becomes readily accessible. But what if you don’t have CATALYSTs yet? The Sandbox plans to distribute CATALYSTs to ecosystem contributors, including LAND owners, as part of their commitment to expanding opportunities for creators.\nExisting ASSET holders need not worry about the fate of their assets. Minted assets on the Ethereum chain will remain usable and can be bridged to the Polygon layer in the future. Non-minted assets, like equipment, will be migrated to align with the new structure, ensuring a smooth transition for users.\nGas fees have long been a concern for NFT enthusiasts, but The Sandbox addresses this by significantly reducing fees on the Polygon marketplace. Additionally, they cover a portion of Polygon transaction fees for users across their ecosystem, enhancing affordability.\nThe user interface of the marketplace has undergone a revamp, with improved asset upload flows, asset moderation, and an enhanced user experience. This ensures a seamless and efficient trading experience for users.\nTo buy your first NFT on Polygon via The Sandbox Marketplace, you need to log in, connect your wallet to the Polygon network, browse the marketplace, select your desired NFT, and complete the purchase. The process is streamlined, making it accessible to both newcomers and seasoned collectors.\nAs The Sandbox expands its metaverse and NFT offerings, creators are encouraged to participate in VoxEdit contests and contribute to the vibrant community. The launch of the new marketplace also comes with a captivating collection from 30 talented artists, adding to the diversity of available ASSETs.\nThe Sandbox’s move to launch its marketplace on Polygon opens up exciting opportunities for creators and collectors alike. With reduced fees, improved user experience, and a commitment to accessibility, it marks a significant step forward in the ever-evolving world of NFTs.\n"

In a surprising move, the creators have decided to shut down the P2E and NFT features of the Game due to a growing problem of rampant cheating.\nThis move, announced on December 13, has left the gaming community in awe as Immortal Game was initially hailed as a pioneering platform aiming to provide players with a legitimate opportunity to earn income through chess. However, their noble intentions have backfired, leading to an influx of unfair practices and cheating within the Game.\nThe root of the problem is the large sums of cash rewards offered with no entry barriers, which inadvertently encouraged players to exploit the system. In their announcement, immortal Game’s developers noted that this situation degraded the experience for genuine players who sought a fair and secure environment to enjoy online chess.\nStarting immediately, the marketplace for Immortal Game NFTs will be discontinued, and players will no longer be able to use the native P2E Checkmate token (CMT) within the Game. While NFTs will continue on the blockchain, users will no longer receive CMT rewards for participating in tournaments or daily challenges. Instead, fiat currency rewards may be introduced as an alternative.\nIn a further adjustment, users will no longer see their ETH and CMT balances displayed on the platform, although these tokens will remain in their wallets. Those using custodial wallets must connect a personal wallet to facilitate asset transfers.\nBefore its discontinuation, Immortal Game NFTs had amassed a lifetime trading volume of $885,600, while the CMT token boasted a fully diluted market capitalization of $360,075. These NFTs were minted on the Immutable blockchain, adding to the gaming landscape.\nThis decision by Immortal Game’s developers marks a turning point in the P2E and NFT gaming industry, as it highlights the challenges and pitfalls associated with offering substantial financial incentives to players. It remains to be seen whether other projects in the space will follow suit or find innovative solutions to combat cheating while maintaining the allure of play-to-earn gaming.\n"

Currently facing 91 felony charges on allegations of business fraud and efforts to overturn the 2020 U.S. presidential election, it’s important to note that the U.S. Constitution does not automatically disqualify suspects or convicted individuals from running for federal office. Enforcing the 14th Amendment, which bars condemned insurrectionists from holding public office, would require congressional action.\nIn the world of NFTs, where art and history intersect with digital innovation, President Trump’s “MugShot” drop adds another layer of intrigue and controversy, reflecting the ongoing narrative of his legal battles and political ambitions. This collection will draw attention and scrutiny as NFTs captivate the digital art world.\n"

Despite making steady progress in his health recovery, Aronow has firmly stated that he is not yet ready to return, emphasizing the importance of ensuring his long-term well-being.\nAronow, who also goes by the name Gordon Goner, had taken a leave of absence from Yuga Labs in late January due to a congestive heart failure diagnosis. At that time, he clarified that he would continue to serve as a board member and strategic adviser to the company.\nIn his recent statement, Aronow revealed the unpredictable nature of his health journey, describing days when he feels ready to dive back into work and others when he feels the need for immediate medical attention.\nWhile he has been away, Aronow has been watching Yuga Labs’ operations, responsible for popular NFT projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and CryptoPunks. He has identified key issues hindering the company’s progress and has suggested necessary changes during board meetings.\nDespite his absence, Aronow expressed confidence in the current leadership of Yuga Labs, especially as the company faces a critical year in 2024. He believes the team is well-prepared to meet the challenges and impress the community.\nBefore stepping back, Aronow acknowledged that he had pushed himself to the limits, working long hours nearly every day. He admitted that he should have heeded the advice of those around him and sought a better work-life balance. \nYuga Labs has not stood still during Aronow’s absence, appointing Daniel Alegre, the former president and chief operating officer of Activision Blizzard, as its new CEO about a month before Aronow’s leave.\nIn February 2021, Aronow co-founded Yuga Labs alongside Greg Solano, Zeshan Ali, and Kerem Atalay. The company’s portfolio includes notable NFTs such as CryptoPunks, BAYC, MeeBits, and Othersidemeta.\nAronow’s commitment to his health and support to Yuga Labs from the sidelines highlight the resilience and determination of the entrepreneur and the NFT industry in navigating challenges and uncertainties.\n"

    "content": "South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) has issued a new directive that will impact digital asset investors and exchanges in the country. According to the FSC’s notice, starting from July 2024, investors who deposit their digital assets into exchanges will be entitled to receive interest on their deposits. This move is part of South Korea’s efforts to regulate the crypto space more comprehensively.\nHowever, there are exceptions to this new rule. Nonfungible tokens (NFTs) and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have been excluded from the mandate. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs reflects the unique nature of these digital assets, which may not fit the criteria for interest-bearing deposits.\nInterestingly, the FSC has left room for potential exceptions to this exclusion. If certain NFTs are categorized as payment methods and are issued in significant quantities, they may be reclassified as virtual assets and become eligible for interest when deposited into exchanges. This shows the regulator’s flexibility in adapting to the evolving landscape of digital assets.\nIn addition to addressing interest on deposits, the FSC has also laid out guidelines for the safe handling of user deposits by virtual asset operators. Exchanges are now required to segregate user deposits from their own assets and entrust them to a bank. Furthermore, a substantial portion, specifically 80%, of the coins must be stored in a secure cold wallet, enhancing security measures.\nThe FSC’s directive also covers preparations for potential hacks or computer incidents. Virtual asset service providers are mandated to either acquire insurance or accumulate reserves to mitigate the impact of such incidents. Additionally, the new law prohibits exchanges from blocking deposits or withdrawals unless it is deemed absolutely necessary and authorized by the courts or financial regulators.\nSouth Korea has been actively solidifying its regulatory framework for the cryptocurrency industry. Earlier in December, financial regulators called on users to report unlicensed crypto exchanges operating within the country. This initiative was led by the Digital Asset Exchange Association and the Financial Intelligence Unit of South Korea.\nAs South Korea continues to adapt to the ever-evolving landscape of digital assets, these regulatory changes aim to strike a balance between investor protection and industry growth. The FSC’s decision to exclude NFTs and CBDCs, while allowing for potential exceptions, highlights the need for flexible and nuanced regulation in the world of cryptocurrencies.\n"

DappRadar, a decentralized app tracking platform, released data revealing that NFT trading has embraced the bullish wave, marking the second consecutive month of upward momentum.\nThe report from DappRadar indicates a remarkable 125% increase in NFT trading volume in November, signaling a significant shift in user behavior compared to previous downtrends in NFT activity. Notably, this surge comes amid a broader positive trend in the cryptocurrency markets.\nExecutives within the Web3 space are optimistic about the continuation of this trend. Jonathan Perkins, the co-founder of SuperRare, conveyed to Cointelegraph on November 14 that the worst of the bear market appears to be behind us, suggesting a favorable outlook for the NFT sector in the coming months.\nIn addition to the surge in trading volume, the average value of NFT transactions experienced an impressive 114% increase, climbing from $126 to $270 throughout November. This indicates a growing confidence and willingness among participants to engage in higher-value transactions within the NFT space.\nDappRadar’s report also sheds light on the increased daily unique active wallets (UAW) in blockchain gaming, witnessing a 14% rise. The decentralized applications industry saw blockchain gaming with a 34% market dominance, reinforcing its status as a fundamental pillar in the decentralized ecosystem.\nDespite a seemingly bearish mood throughout the year, blockchain gaming projects have managed to secure a substantial $2.3 billion in investments from the beginning of 2023 up to October. This resilience is particularly evident in the third quarter of 2023, where blockchain gaming secured an impressive $600 million in investments, even amidst lower cryptocurrency market prices than previous peaks.\nIn conclusion, the NFT market’s remarkable resurgence and the resilience of blockchain gaming investments paint a picture of a dynamic and evolving landscape within the cryptocurrency space. As the crypto markets turn bullish, these trends may signal a broader shift in user sentiment and behavior, marking a positive outlook for the industry in the months ahead.\n"

Owned by Adidas, Reebok has formed a unique partnership with the crypto tech startup Futureverse, marking a significant step towards integrating AI and blockchain technologies into their products.\n\nThis collaboration aims to revolutionize digital fashion and extend Reebok’s brand into virtual spaces. The plan includes the development of AI-enhanced and blockchain-supported games and digital experiences. This initiative brings Reebok’s styles into the digital world as wearable NFTs and emphasizes creating immersive virtual gaming experiences.\nA critical project in this partnership is “Reebok Impact,” which is slated for launch next year. This initiative is described as a “mind and heart-bending digital shoe experience” that integrates AI technology with on-chain digital wearables. The goal is to illustrate that life’s essence is not just about the sneakers one wears but about one’s experiences while wearing them. Reebok CEO Todd Krinsky highlighted the importance of participating in the world purposefully, and this partnership with Futureverse is seen as a step towards redefining the limits of innovation and consumer engagement in the digital evolution of products.\nFutureverse, which secured $54 million in Series A funding in July, aims to create an “open metaverse” where digital assets like NFTs can move freely across multiple platforms. The company is expanding its ecosystem by acquiring other crypto firms, games, and metaverse experiences, although this collaboration with Reebok marks its first foray into digital footwear.\nIn comparison, Nike acquired RTFKT, an NFT sneaker studio, in December 2021, leading the footwear industry into the virtual domain. Since then, Nike has built a robust NFT community and released exclusive physical sneaker collections with digital counterparts. Following this trend, brands like Adidas, Dior, and Puma have launched similar “phygital” products.\nWhile Reebok has not announced any plans for physical sneakers linked to digital tokens yet, it has revealed a limited-edition sneaker drop in collaboration with Gary Vaynerchuk’s NFT brand VeeFriends. This special edition will initially be available to VeeFriends token holders before being released globally.\nReebok’s partnership with Futureverse represents a significant move into the digital realm, blending AI and blockchain technology to create unique gaming and digital fashion experiences, potentially reshaping how consumers interact with the brand in virtual spaces.\n"

Their excitement is palpable, signaling a significant shift in how fans engage with music icons.\nThe collection, named MegadethDigital, features 5,000 generative pieces. It stars Vic Rattlehead, the band’s digital mascot, in a fresh artistic vision. The initiative, set to go live on December 22, transcends typical fan club boundaries. Hence, it promises a community-owned experience, blending the real and the virtual worlds.\n\nMoreover, these NFTs are not mere collectibles. They serve as keys to exclusive content and experiences. Holders can access special merchandise and VIP events. Additionally, they offer chances for one-on-one interactions with band members. This approach adds a tangible, personal touch to digital assets.\nMegadeth’s foray into NFTs mirrors a growing trend in the heavy metal genre.

Consequently, this movement signifies a broader acceptance of NFTs in the music industry.\n\nSignificantly, Megadeth’s move is more than a nod to current trends. It is a strategic embrace of technology for deeper fan engagement. Their NFTs act as a bridge, connecting the virtual and physical fan experiences. This innovative approach could set a new standard for artist-fan interactions.\nHowever, the initiative’s success hinges on the fans’ reception and participation. Early responses suggest a positive outlook. Fans are eager to explore this new dimension of their favorite band.

    "content": "In the dynamic world of Ethereum NFTs, a recent revelation about a vulnerability in Thirdweb’s smart contracts has sent ripples through the community. Thirdweb, known for its crypto development tools, disclosed a significant issue in a widely used open-source library for Web3 smart contracts. This discovery has prompted a swift response from Ethereum NFT marketplaces and creators, underscoring the urgency of securing digital assets.\nThe vulnerability, which remains undisclosed to prevent exploitation, affects pre-built contracts provided by Thirdweb and potentially others. Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized apps and NFT collections, making this a critical concern for stakeholders. OpenZeppelin, another prominent player in smart contract libraries, clarified that the problem does not originate from its repository. Despite this, the company has committed to leading the community in identifying affected parties and offering mitigation strategies.\n\nIn a proactive measure, Thirdweb advises projects to lock down their current smart contracts and transition to new ones, ensuring the safety of their collections. The firm has also pledged to support affected parties financially by covering the network fees for this migration. This recommendation comes after Thirdweb implemented a fix to its smart contract templates on November 22, ensuring that contracts deployed after this date are secure.\nThe exploit impacts NFT smart contracts adhering to Ethereum’s ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards and ERC-20 standard fungible tokens. Thirdweb’s blog post provides a detailed list of affected contract types and a tool for identifying compromised contracts.\nSeveral major industry players have weighed in on the situation. OpenSea and Rarible, leading NFT marketplaces, are exploring ways to assist collection owners with contract migrations. Coinbase revealed that some collections on its NFT platform are affected, while Manifold, a smart contract startup, confirmed its contracts are safe. Base, an Ethereum layer-2 network, acknowledged the impact on some project contracts but assured the network’s security.\nEthereum profile picture project Cool Cats and Animoca Brands’ Mocaverse gaming platform are moving to new contracts to safeguard their NFT collections. In response to the challenge, Thirdweb has doubled its bug bounty payments to $50,000 and committed to a more stringent auditing process in the future. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in the rapidly evolving field of NFTs and the importance of robust security measures to protect digital assets in the decentralized space.\n"

These investments include the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection and the NFT marketplace OpenSea. Bloomberg’s recent report reveals that Tiger Global slashed its BAYC stakes by 69% and OpenSea holdings by 94%. Moreover, the firm has also cut valuations for several other portfolio companies.\nTiger Global’s decision reflects a cautious approach towards the volatile crypto market. The firm has been diversifying its investments in the crypto realm, focusing on NFTs and blockchain security and privacy-focused initiatives. In 2021, it co-led a $24 million funding round for blockchain security company CertiK, emphasizing its commitment to enhancing decentralized finance (DeFi) security.\nFurthermore, in 2022, Tiger Global participated in a Series B investment for Aleo, a zero-knowledge applications platform, which successfully raised $200 million. This round saw leading investors like Kora Management LP and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Additionally, the firm invested in Polygon, a layer-2 network, showcasing its broad interest in crypto.\nHowever, Tiger Global is not alone in this cautious stance. Coatue Management, another major player and co-lead investor in OpenSea, recently marked down its investment in the NFT marketplace by 90%. This reduction brought OpenSea’s valuation down to $1.4 billion, a significant decrease from its previous valuation.\nThese markdowns by Tiger Global and Coatue Management signal a broader trend of reevaluation within the NFT market. Investors are becoming more circumspect, primarily due to fluctuating market values. Consequently, this shift could lead to more conservative investment strategies in the NFT and broader crypto sectors.\nBesides these adjustments, these investment giants’ moves underscore the NFT space’s evolving nature. Hence, as the market matures, further recalibrations in investments are likely. These developments may pave the way for more stable and sustainable growth in the crypto and NFT sectors in the long run.\n"

Moreover, this innovation ensures that creators receive the royalties due to them, solidifying their success in the digital realm.\nSignificantly, the introduction of the RARI Chain follows Rarible’s impressive trading volume surge. This uptick occurred after Rarible’s firm stance on maintaining creator royalties in August. They excluded marketplaces like OpenSea and Blur.io from their data aggregation for not supporting these royalties. This move reflects Rarible’s dedication to creator rights and has led to a 637% increase in trading volume within 24 hours, as reported by DappRadar.\n\nMoreover, the RARI Chain is not just another blockchain solution. It represents a pivotal shift in how creators’ earnings are protected in the Web3 ecosystem. Alex Salnikov, co-founder of Rarible, emphasizes the need for a “creator-centric ecosystem.” He asserts that embedding royalties at the node level isn’t just a promise but a guarantee of creator earnings. This approach ensures a sustainable economy for digital creators.\nAdditionally, the RARI Foundation’s partnership with key players like Arbitrum, LayerZero, and WalletConnect substantially supports the new chain. From the Arbitrum Foundation, Nina Rong highlights the importance of fair compensation for creators. She points out that enforcing royalties at the node level advances this goal.\n\nHowever, this is about more than just technology. It’s about reshaping the digital landscape to favor creators. The RARI Chain stands as a testament to the potential of blockchain technology in protecting the interests of digital artists and creators. It marks a significant stride in preventing the disintermediation of creators from the burgeoning growth of Web3.\nThe RARI Foundation’s latest initiative with RARI Chain brings a new era in NFT trading and creator compensation.

This insight emerges from a trio of studies conducted by academicians from several prestigious institutions, offering a fresh perspective on the factors influencing the NFT landscape.\nAt the forefront of these studies, researchers Guneet Kaur Nagpal from Western University and Luc Renneboog from Tilburg University explored the market dynamics of CryptoPunks, a leading NFT asset collection. Their study, “On Nonfungible Tokens, Blockchain Hypes, and the Creation of Scarcity,” highlighted that Ethereum (ETH) investors were more inclined to engage in higher-cost market activities and experienced significant gains. Interestingly, the study noted that ETH’s market performance did not directly influence NFT prices but impacted decisions on asset sales.\nMeanwhile, Chuyi Sun of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill delved into how personal experiences shape market behavior in the NFT domain. In the study “Personal Experience Effects across Markets: Evidence from NFT and Cryptocurrency Investing,” Sun analyzed data from approximately one million wallets. The findings revealed that investors receiving more valuable NFTs in initial offerings were likelier to engage in subsequent NFT purchases and gravitate towards speculative cryptocurrencies.\nContrastingly, a study from the Rennes School of Business, “The Impact of Experience, Overconfidence and Optimism on Future Cryptocurrency Ownership,” conducted by Akanksha Jalan and Roman Matkovskyy, brought to light an intriguing aspect of investor behavior. Contrary to expectations, negative past experiences and investor optimism positively influenced future engagements in cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This trend suggests a unique resilience among investors, attributing losses to external factors like market volatility rather than personal decision-making.\nThese studies offer a nuanced understanding of the NFT market, moving beyond conventional economic models. They underscore the importance of personal experiences and psychological factors in driving market trends. This research paves the way for a deeper exploration of the human elements behind the burgeoning world of NFTs, suggesting that market movements are as much about individual stories and perceptions as they are about economic indicators.\nThe recent findings challenge traditional market theories, highlighting the complex interplay of personal experiences, luck, scarcity, and optimism in shaping the future of NFTs. This new knowledge enriches our understanding of the NFT market and opens doors for more human-centric approaches to studying digital asset economies.\n"

This platform stands out for its strategic use of the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), significantly reducing the network congestion and high fees often associated with Bitcoin Ordinals inscriptions.\nDeveloped in the wake of the creation of Bitcoin Ordinals in early 2023, Bioniq is set to revolutionize the way Bitcoin-based NFTs are traded. Leveraging the ICP’s native Bitcoin integration, Bioniq has crafted a seamless marketplace featuring innovative contract auctions and a comprehensive cross-chain wallet bridging Bitcoin and ICP. Bob Bodily, CEO and co-founder of Bioniq emphasized the platform’s quick response to the immense potential of Ordinals, starting its development as early as February 2023.\nThe platform’s innovation doesn’t stop there. Bioniq introduces an intelligent wallet, enabling users to manage their private keys through Web3Auth. This feature brings the convenience of logging in via standard Web2 Google accounts while retaining noncustodial control over wallets and assets.\nFurthermore, Bioniq capitalizes on the advantages of partially signed Bitcoin transactions (PSBTs) integrated within the ICP’s Bitcoin network. This integration allows for smart contract capabilities directly on Bitcoin, bypassing the need for centralized cross-chain bridges.\nBacked by influential names like Polychain Capital, Bioniq takes a unique approach by treating Internet Computers as a Bitcoin layer-2 network. This strategy harnesses the ICP’s efficiencies in time and cost through a token-wrapping process. Users can transfer their Bitcoin and Ordinals assets into Bioniq’s wallet, opting to wrap their assets for safekeeping while generating equivalent NFTs on the ICP network. This process enables trading on the ICP network, free from the usual gas or transaction fees and immune to the Bitcoin network’s speed limitations.\nBioniq’s launch addresses the market capitalization growth of BRC-20 tokens and tackles the issue of Bitcoin network congestion. The platform’s unique approach offers a more reliable and efficient trading experience, even in high Bitcoin fee environments.\nLooking ahead, Bioniq plans to expand its offerings, including a launchpad for new collections, a crypto borrowing feature using Ordinals assets as collateral, and a platform for collection offers targeting specific projects. This holistic approach marks a significant step forward in the crypto marketplace, bringing efficiency and innovation to the forefront.\n"

    "content": "The digital asset space is witnessing a remarkable surge in the value and popularity of Mad Lads, a Solana-based profile picture (PFP) NFT collection. Outperforming many leading NFT projects, Mad Lads has reached new heights in its floor price and sales volume.\nAs noted by Solana Floor data, Mad Lads’ entry price has recently experienced a significant increase. The collection’s floor price now stands at 123 SOL, equating to over $7,100. This marks a substantial rise, with the price more than tripling in November alone. On November 13, Decrypt reported the collection’s floor value at nearly $4,500 worth of SOL, highlighting a robust growth trajectory.\nRegarding sales, Mad Lads is making waves in the secondary markets. Over the past 24 hours, sales have exceeded $1.39 million, according to CryptoSlam data. This volume surpasses other notable NFT projects, including the Fortune Founder’s Pass from Army of Fortune and the renowned Bored Ape Yacht Club on Ethereum. The latter registered approximately $881,000 in sales, while Solana’s Tensorians followed closely with about $810,000.\nSeveral elements contribute to the increasing demand and value of Mad Lads. The Solana token has seen significant appreciation, rising from around $21 to a current value of $58, even touching $65 recently. This price increase has impacted the broader Solana NFT market, with sales topping $62 million in November, a steep rise from October’s $28 million.\nMad Lads distinguishes itself with unique attributes. Developed by startup Coral, the collection integrates with the Backpack app and its executable NFTs (xNFTs) standard, providing a range of experiences around tokenized assets. Coral’s upcoming crypto exchange, licensed in Dubai and led by former FTX general counsel Can Sun, has also added to the project’s appeal. Mad Lads NFT holders were given priority access to exchange signups and received PYTH tokens during the recent Pyth Network airdrop on Solana.\nThese factors, combined with the project’s innovative approach and exclusive holder benefits, fuel the increasing demand for Mad Lads NFTs.\nMad Lads’ success is not just a triumph for the project itself but also signifies a pivotal moment in the NFT sector, especially for Solana-based projects. Its performance against Ethereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club, a long-time leader in the NFT market, suggests a shift in investor interest toward Solana’s ecosystem.\nThis shift could lead to increased competition and innovation within the NFT space as projects strive to offer unique benefits and experiences to their communities. As the NFT market continues to evolve, the success of collections like Mad Lads will likely inspire new developments and trends within this dynamic and ever-changing industry.\n"

    "content": "In a recent turn of events, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) community has witnessed an alarming scam attempt. A member of this prestigious NFT group, known as Crumz, narrowly escaped a well-orchestrated scheme. The scam, posing as an opportunity for an interview with Forbes, targeted Crumz through a direct message from an impersonator of Robert LaFanco, a real Forbes editor.\nCrumz faced several red flags during the interview, including the interviewer’s non-premium Zoom account and a request to use a separate recorder bot for screen recording. Despite these signs, Crumz initially complied with the requests. The scammer asked Crumz to fetch a banana, supposedly to add a personal touch related to his BAYC NFT. However, Crumz later realized that this request was a ploy to distract him and gain control of his computer remotely.\n\nUpon refusing to leave his computer, Crumz observed the scammers attempting to take over his screen. He acted quickly to prevent any potential theft of his valuable digital assets. This incident highlights the growing sophistication of scams within the NFT community. Similar scams have been reported, involving fake journalists luring NFT owners into compromising their security for a supposed media feature.\nThis case serves as a warning to the NFT community, particularly high-value asset holders like BAYC members. The incident underscores the importance of vigilance and skepticism when dealing with unsolicited offers, especially those involving access to personal or digital assets. The BAYC community and broader NFT holders are now more aware of these tactics, thanks to the sharing of this experience by Crumz and others who have encountered similar situations.\nAs the NFT market thrives, collectors must stay informed and cautious. This incident not only reflects the vulnerabilities within the digital asset space but also the resilience of its members in the face of evolving cyber threats.\n"

The unique ‘Influencer Box,’ a blend of physical and digital collectibles, demonstrates the brand’s innovative approach in a fluctuating market. It aimed at mainstream consumers; this box includes a variety of engaging items: a 12-inch plush toy, an action figure, a clip-on plush, an igloo toy, and a certificate for a complimentary NFT on the zkSync Era, redeemable on the Pudgy World gaming platform.\nWith a promotional price of $25, exclusively available on Walmart.com, this bundle represents significant savings from its regular combined item value.

The collection’s impressive value increase highlights this growth trajectory: an all-time high of over $13,000 in ETH, marking a sevenfold rise since Netz’s takeover in April 2022.\nDespite the broader market downturn since May 2022, Pudgy Penguins stands out as a resilient and growing NFT project in USD value.

    "content": "In a significant shift, Azuki DAO, the decentralized autonomous organization associated with the Azuki nonfungible token (NFT) series, has announced a rebranding to “Bean.” This change comes alongside the decision to drop a previously proposed lawsuit against the NFT collection’s founder, Zagabond. The legal action concerned a contentious $39 million NFT minting event in June, initially stirring up substantial debate within the community.\nMoreover, the rebranding marks a strategic pivot for the DAO. Bean will transition into a memecoin project as part of its new direction, integrating into the Ethereum layer-2 Blast ecosystem. This move will enhance the project’s presence and capabilities within the digital asset space.\nDevelopers have revealed that Bean has already garnered significant support, securing $10 million in funding from notable investors. This financial backing aims to accelerate the project’s growth and development within the Blast ecosystem. The proposed Bean memecoin will have a total supply of 1 billion tokens, indicating the project’s ambitions for widespread adoption and utility.\nAdditionally, there have been updates regarding the token distribution plan. Initially, as outlined on the DAO’s website, the plan detailed a 40% allocation of tokens to the treasury, 50% to Azuki DAO members, and 10% to Zagabond, the Azuki NFT creator. It also stated that minting would be exclusively available to Azuki NFT holders, with a 24-hour window for action, after which any unclaimed tokens would be subject to burn.\nHowever, recent clarifications indicate changes in the distribution strategy. The follow-up statement from the developers specified that “50% of the $Bean [token] was allocated to the Azuki DAO community for the airdrop of Azuki series NFTs,” a process concluded four months ago. The statement also confirmed that “40% of $Bean [token] was allocated to the Bean Treasury, and 10% of $Bean was allocated to Zagabond.”\nThis rebranding and strategic shift signify a new chapter for the former Azuki DAO, now Bean. By dropping the lawsuit and embarking on a fresh path with a memecoin project, the organization is set to explore new horizons in the blockchain and NFT sphere. The move reflects decentralized organizations’ dynamic and evolving nature and the digital asset industry.\n"

    "content": "Square Enix, the renowned developer behind the Final Fantasy series, has recently unveiled its latest venture into the world of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) by announcing auction dates for its upcoming blockchain game, Symbiogenesis. Set to revolutionize the gaming and digital collectible experience, Symbiogenesis introduces a unique blend of narrative-driven gameplay and Ethereum-based NFTs. This innovative approach marks a significant stride in Square Enix’s exploration of blockchain technology following their successful introduction of Final Fantasy NFT trading cards earlier this year.\n\nThe auctions for Symbiogenesis NFTs are scheduled in three distinct phases, each offering a different array of digital collectibles. The first phase, slated for Nov 27 to 28, is an exclusive event targeting early backers, termed “stakeholders.” This phase will feature a selection of facet and mesh characters intricately designed to capture the essence of the Symbiogenesis universe. This exclusive access underscores the company’s appreciation for early investors’ support.\nFollowing this, the second auction phase, from Nov 30 to Dec 4, and the third phase, from Dec 2 to 3, will open doors to a broader audience. Eligibility for these phases was determined through an allowlist entry campaign, which Square Enix conducted from Nov 7 to 21. This campaign was an engaging blend of quizzes and a treasure hunt within a prototype of the game world, adding an interactive element to the qualification process.\nTop performers in the campaign, specifically the 50 highest scorers, along with 40 randomly chosen participants from the 51st to 300th rank, earned the privilege to acquire NFTs in the second phase. The remaining participants can bid in the third phase, ensuring an inclusive participation spectrum.\nSymbiogenesis, described as a “narrative-unlocked NFT entertainment” game, is more than a digital collectible platform. It promises an immersive story-driven experience intertwined with the ownership and trade of unique NFTs. The scheduled launch date for this ambitious project is Dec 21, a day anticipated by gaming and crypto enthusiasts alike.\nSquare Enix’s move into blockchain gaming reflects the company’s adaptability and innovative spirit in the ever-evolving digital entertainment landscape. With a legacy of over 173 million units sold in the Final Fantasy series alone, Square Enix’s foray into NFTs with Symbiogenesis is not just an expansion of their digital offerings but a testament to their commitment to staying at the forefront of gaming technology. As the gaming world eagerly awaits the arrival of Symbiogenesis, it stands as a beacon of the exciting possibilities that blockchain technology brings to interactive storytelling and digital ownership.\n"

    "content": "The iconic NFT collection Cool Cats took a significant leap into mainstream visibility, debuting as a balloon in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This move coincides with the launch of a YouTube Shorts series, “The Milk Chug.” Hence, it marks a pivotal moment for the brand, which originated from the creative mind of artist Colin ‘Clon’ Egan.\n\nInitially, Clon’s Cool Cats appeared as simple artwork. However, they gained substantial traction after transitioning to Instagram in 2015. The pivotal year for Cool Cats was 2021 when 9,999 Blue Cat PFPs (Profile Picture) NFTs were released. Significantly, the collection became a “blue chip” project in the NFT boom, with prices peaking at an average of $92,000.\nHowever, the road could have been smoother. The broader crypto market downturn and community discontent saw a drop in the value of these NFTs. Consequently, the Cool Cats Group sought to diversify and expand its reach. This strategy included plans to extend to multiple blockchain networks and license its IP to game studios.\nMoreover, this diversification strategy is already in motion. Notably, three well-established gaming publishers, nWay, iCandy, and Sync Studios, have been tapped for game development using the Cool Cats brand. All these games are currently in the works and are expected to be released between 2023 and 2024.\nAdditionally, a limited-edition Cool Cats hoodie will be available in a unique blend of physical and digital worlds. This hoodie, featuring an NFC tag linked to an Azuki physical-backed token, illustrates the brand’s commitment to integrating its digital assets with real-world products.\n\nThis strategic expansion into gaming and merchandise and its high-profile appearance at the Macy’s Parade positions Cool Cats as a forward-thinking brand. It is adapting to the changing landscapes of digital assets and consumer engagement. The Cool Cats’ foray into various entertainment and product avenues signifies its evolution from a simple NFT collection to a comprehensive global brand. Consequently, this positions Cool Cats not just as a player in the digital art world but as a multifaceted entertainment and lifestyle brand.\n"

Consequently, this inflow of capital marks a significant milestone for the company. Folius Ventures spearheaded this A-2 round. Moreover, SevenX, a crypto VC firm, contributed as a co-lead investor. Additionally, the investment was joined by notable names like ABCDE Capital, Jambo, and Initiate Capital. Find Satoshi Lab, known for Stepn and Gas Hero, also participated.\n\nJason Kam, the founder of Folius Ventures, expressed confidence in Matr1x. He highlighted the company’s potential to redefine the gaming industry. Hence, Kam believes Matr1x could navigate the crypto slowdown and achieve mass market appeal. Significantly, Matr1x is focusing on a first-person shooter game, Matr1x Fire. This game draws aesthetic inspiration from Riot Games’ Valorant. It features similar maps, weapons, and character designs.\nMatr1x Fire emphasizes team play, where five-person teams compete. However, unlike Valorant, it eschews special powers for a skill-based approach. This approach aligns more with CS:GO’s gameplay style. Additionally, Matr1x aims to establish an esports presence for its game, which remains under development.\nThe studio has introduced two NFT collections and is currently in the process of developing a third collection. This upcoming collection will provide opportunities for governance participation and a stake in the creator economy, along with featuring an upgradeable Battle Pass.\nHowever, there are concerns within the gaming community. Some gamers draw parallels between Matr1x Fire and NetEase’s Hyper Front. Riot Games previously sued NetEase over Hyper Front, alleging it copied Valorant. As a result, Hyper Front was shut down. Many fear a similar fate for Matr1x Fire. The game has already garnered labels like “Valorant Mobile” in early-access footage.\nDespite these concerns, Matr1x is forging ahead. The company is transparent in its distinction from Valorant. It emphasizes a different gaming experience, focusing on gunplay and tactics. This distinction is crucial for Matr1x Fire to avoid legal entanglements and carve its niche. The funding and development trajectory of Matr1x signals a potentially transformative period in mobile gaming. Hence, the industry is watching closely, anticipating the impact of Matr1x’s ambitious projects.\n"

CoinGecko’s co-founder and chief operating officer, Bobby Ong, emphasized that this integration will provide a unified crypto data experience. Users will have seamless access to fungible and nonfungible token data, enriching their insights into the crypto market.\nMoreover, CoinGecko users, both on web and mobile applications, will soon benefit from direct access to on-chain NFT data.

This innovation is expected to extend beyond Profile Pictures (PFPs) and Game Finance (GameFi), leading to new global opportunities and use cases.\nCoinGecko’s proactive approach follows the 2020 acquisition of its main rival, CoinMarketCap, by Binance.

    "content": "In a significant development in the digital art world, Aurelien Michel, a French national, has admitted to a major fraud involving the sale of Mutant Ape Planet NFTs. This collection, a derivative of the renowned Mutant Ape Yacht Club by Yuga Labs, became the center of a $3 million fraud scheme. Michel’s guilty plea to conspiracy to commit wire fraud was entered in a New York federal court, as announced by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York on November 14.\nMichel and his associates were accused of deceitfully marketing these NFTs, promising investors rewards and benefits to spur demand. However, these promises were never fulfilled. Instead, the proceeds, amounting to millions of dollars, were diverted for personal use. This act, known as a “rug pull” in cryptocurrency, left investors facing significant losses.\n\nSpecial agent Thomas M. Fattorusso of the IRS Criminal Investigation in New York emphasized the gravity of Michel’s actions, noting the transformation of investors’ dreams into a “nightmare of deception and losses.” The case underscores the risks inherent in the largely unregulated NFT market, where the line between innovative investment and fraudulent schemes can often blur.\nMichel’s arrest in January 2023 marked a turning point in the case. Following his arrest, he admitted to the community via social media that the project was indeed a rug pull, a confession that came amidst growing toxicity within the community.\nUpon sentencing, Michel faces up to five years in prison. Moreover, he has agreed to pay $1.4 million in restitution. This case highlights the ongoing challenges in the NFT space, where the excitement and novelty of digital assets often collide with the harsh realities of unscrupulous practices.\nThe Mutant Ape Planet collection, once a prominent offering on the NFT platform OpenSea, showcased 6,797 NFTs minted on the Ethereum blockchain. Initially, the group enjoyed substantial sales, with over 320 Ether in volume by February 2022. However, its value had significantly declined by April of the same year. By Michel’s arrest, the average price and total sales volume had plummeted to near zero, reflecting the collapse of trust and value in the wake of the fraud.\nMichel’s case is a cautionary tale in the rapidly evolving world of NFTs. It highlights the need for greater oversight and consumer protection in a market that continues to captivate and confound investors and enthusiasts alike.\n"

Backpack’s latest endeavor involves launching a cryptocurrency exchange in Dubai, a move bolstered by the appointment of former FTX general counsel Can Sun as the leader of this new venture.\nBackpack’s association with the soaring Mad Lads NFTs is undeniable. These digital collectibles have witnessed a remarkable price surge, starting at 82.37 SOL (approximately $4,480) on secondary marketplaces. This figure represents a substantial increase from their previous high, especially notable given Solana’s 148% rise over the past month.\nCan Sun’s role be pivotal in developing Trek Labs, the Dubai-based startup connected to Backpack and its creator, Coral? Having recently testified in the fraud trial against FTX co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried, Sun brings a wealth of experience and insight. This move comes after Trek Labs secured a Virtual Asset Service Provider license from Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), setting the stage for a regulated exchange in the United Arab Emirates.\nThe ripple effect of these developments extends beyond just the realms of cryptocurrency and legal expertise. Coral co-founder and CEO Armani Ferrante, a minority shareholder in Trek Labs, and Claire Zhang, Sun’s former deputy at FTX and Ferrante’s spouse, add interconnectedness between these entities.\nMoreover, Trek Labs has unveiled plans to sell a 10% stake in the company, seeking a valuation surpassing $100 million. This ambitious target reflects the growing confidence and potential in the digital asset space, particularly in a region as dynamic as Dubai.\nThe recent beta signups for the Backpack exchange, initially exclusive to Mad Lads NFT holders, have further fueled interest in these digital assets. The strategic move of offering early access to NFT owners underscores the increasing integration of various facets of the digital asset ecosystem.\nThe intertwined developments among Backpack, Trek Labs, and the Mad Lads NFT collection signify a burgeoning era in the digital asset world. The incorporation of experienced professionals and strategic business moves is setting a new course for the future of cryptocurrency exchanges and NFT marketplaces, particularly in the vibrant landscape of Dubai’s digital economy.\n"

Recent data reveals a significant uptick in trading volumes and prices, injecting optimism into the market.\nOctober marked a pivotal month in this revival, showcasing a 32% increase in NFT trading volume compared to September. This rise, quantified at $405 million, signals a shift in trader sentiment. Although these figures still lag behind the zenith of January 2022, which saw about $5 billion in trades, the increase is nonetheless a positive indicator.\nPFP Index in USD terms has truly gone parabolic, back at the levels we were at before the Azuki Elementals reveal. pic.twitter.com/FFLFt2txvb\n— NFTstats.eth (@punk9059) November 10, 2023\n\nEssential NFT collections are leading this rebound. CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, and Azuki NFTs have seen their floor prices – the minimum price for NFTs in these collections – surge dramatically. CryptoPunks’ floor price soared by 82%, reaching approximately $125,500. Bored Ape Yacht Club and Azuki NFTs weren’t far behind, with 67% and 107% increases, respectively.\nThis rejuvenation is not solely attributable to the rising crypto prices, though they play a role. Bitcoin and Ethereum have risen by 38% and 33% in the last month. These increases contribute to the enhanced allure of NFTs as valuable digital assets.\nThe trading activity is also gaining momentum. Popular collections like Bored Ape and CryptoPunks have experienced substantial hikes in their trading volumes, by 140% and 1755%, respectively. This upswing is not limited to these well-known names; even lesser-known collections are seeing renewed interest.\nHowever, the scenario isn’t uniformly rosy. Some projects are still struggling to regain their former glory. For instance, DraftKings NFT trading dipped by 40%, and trading on Ethereum’s scaling network, Polygon, saw a 58% decline.\nDespite these variances, the overall trend points to revitalizing the NFT market. This upturn starkly contrasts the previous year and a half, where both crypto and NFT markets were in a slump. The current boost in trading volumes and prices is breathing new life into the space, drawing in long-time traders and new participants.\nIt’s important to note that we are still some distance from the frenzied heights of the initial NFT boom. Nevertheless, the market is showing tangible signs of recovery. This resurgence is a reminder of the dynamic nature of digital assets and their potential for rapid shifts in value and interest. As the landscape evolves, it presents opportunities and challenges for traders and investors in digital assets.\n"

    "content": "China has recently announced a significant legal stance against the theft of digital collections, including nonfungible tokens (NFTs). According to a statement released on November 10, individuals involved in such activities will face theft charges. The Chinese government’s declaration clarifies the legal status of digital collections, categorizing them as data and virtual property, a perspective that aligns with the concept of “co-offending.”\nThe government emphasizes that stealing a digital collection is not just a breach of ownership but also involves illegal access to computer systems. This dual violation, encompassing both property law and computer information system data protection, underlines the seriousness with which China views the theft of digital assets. This approach classifies digital collections, notably NFTs, as “network virtual property,” recognizing their intrinsic value in property law.\nInterestingly, NFTs, known for their unique and tamper-proof nature through blockchain technology, are highlighted in this context. Despite China’s stringent stance on crypto-related activities, this move acknowledges the growing significance of NFTs, which are increasingly seen as valuable assets due to their unique characteristics.\nMoreover, China’s approach to NFTs is evolving. While the country has yet to open a secondary market for digital collections, consumers can engage in transactions through trading platforms. These platforms facilitate various operations, including purchasing, collecting, transferring, and destroying digital assets, thereby granting consumers exclusive possession and control over these virtual properties.\nAdditionally, recent developments indicate a growing interest in NFTs within China. Alibaba’s Xianyu, a peer-to-peer marketplace, recently lifted its censorship on search terms related to NFTs and digital assets. This move, reported on October 25, suggests a softening attitude towards the digital asset market. Further emphasizing this trend, China Daily, a government-owned English-language newspaper, announced plans on October 6 to create its own NFT platform. The newspaper intends to invest 2.813 million Chinese yuan (approximately $390,000) in this venture, indicating the government’s increasing engagement with digital assets.\n"

    "content": "David Baszucki, CEO of the renowned virtual universe game Roblox, recently shared his vision for the future of digital collectibles and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). In an interview with CNBC following Roblox’s Q3 2023 earnings call, Baszucki discussed how major influencers could significantly contribute to the widespread acceptance and adoption of NFTs and digital items. He emphasized the potential for these assets to move seamlessly across various digital platforms, enhancing their value and usability.\nBaszucki’s idea involves enabling users to transfer their digital collectibles from one platform to another. This concept could transform how digital assets are perceived and traded. He cited the example of high-profile celebrities like Elton John collaborating with Roblox to create exclusive digital items, such as capes, for charitable causes. Once sold on Roblox, these limited edition items could become NFTs and be traded on different marketplaces, thus transcending the boundaries of a single digital environment.\nThe Roblox CEO’s remarks came when the company reported a 20% year-over-year increase in bookings, thanks to a surge in in-game spending and an expanding user base. Despite posting a loss in the third quarter, Roblox’s performance indicates a robust and growing interest in digital gaming and e-commerce.\n\nAdditionally, the NFT market has been experiencing a significant uptick. Blockchain analytics firm Nansen highlighted a notable rise in NFT sales volumes in November. Specifically, the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) collection showcased the highest trading volume, amounting to 35,226 ETH, valued at $66.7 million. Concurrently, data from NFTGo revealed a 12% increase in NFT traders over the same period, signaling a growing interest in the NFT space.\nBaszucki’s vision aligns with these market trends, underscoring the potential for digital collectibles to become more than just assets confined to a single platform. His proposal hints at a future where digital items gain new life and value as they traverse different virtual spaces, propelled by the creativity and influence of their creators.\nThis concept of inter-platform mobility for digital assets could redefine the dynamics of digital ownership and trading. It points towards a more interconnected and fluid digital economy, where the lines between different virtual platforms blur, allowing for a more integrated and expansive digital experience.\n"

Kamal expressed his concerns, stating, “I don’t want the price of Apes, the BAYC community, Yuga Labs, or anyone who has supported this Web3 ecosystem to suffer, but neglecting it is something that has offended me so much.”\nYuga Labs responded by indicating that they are still investigating and taking the situation seriously. Speculation on Twitter suggests that UV-C bulbs intended for disinfection might have been used instead of blacklights during the event.\nAs Kamal recounted his distressing visit to Hong Kong’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital, where he received treatment for his eye condition, he described sending a legal notice to Yuga Labs as the “first step toward suing them.” He spoke of feeling helpless during the ordeal and experiencing temporary blindness.\n\nYuga Labs reported that less than 1% of the 2,250 ApeFest attendees exhibited symptoms related to eye issues but encouraged anyone with concerns to seek medical attention as a precaution.\nIn an interview from Dubai, Kamal, now wearing sunglasses, revealed his ongoing vision troubles and discomfort in one eye. Before the incident, he owned a Mutant Ape NFT and purchased a $60,000 Bored Ape to support the BAYC community in front of co-founder Greg “Garga” Solano.\nKamal shared that two other attendees he knows are facing similar symptoms, and he hopes Yuga Labs will prioritize safety measures for future events. He emphasized the importance of safeguarding the community’s well-being, contributing to Yuga Labs’ success.\nIn this unfolding situation, legal action may shed light on the responsibilities of event organizers and creators in ensuring attendee safety at NFT gatherings like ApeFest.\n"

The company has reduced its initial investment of $120 million to a mere $13 million, reflecting a staggering 90% decrease in the value of its stake. This substantial markdown indicates that OpenSea’s on-paper valuation has plummeted to approximately $1.4 billion.\nThis development comes on the heels of Coatue Management’s decision to also mark down its investment in MoonPay, a Web3 payment provider, by a similarly substantial 90%. These markdowns signal a shifting landscape within the NFT and Web3 sectors.\nIn January 2022, OpenSea raised an impressive $300 million in a Series C funding round led by crypto venture capital firm Paradigm and Coatue Management. At that time, the NFT platform was riding high, with a valuation of $13.3 billion. However, the recent bear market and a prolonged decline in NFT trading activity have forced OpenSea to take drastic measures.\nOn November 3, OpenSea announced a workforce reduction of 50% as part of its strategy to relaunch as “OpenSea 2.0.” CEO Devin Fizner stated that this streamlined team would make the platform more agile and responsive. OpenSea’s new version will focus on enhancing its technology, speed, and overall quality.\n\nIt’s worth noting that OpenSea faced criticism earlier in the year when it retired its operator filter, a feature that allowed creators to blocklist non-royalty-enforcing marketplaces, sparking controversy within the NFT community.\nCoatue Management’s decision to mark its investment coincides with a broader slump in NFT trading volumes. After reaching its peak in 2021 with over $14 billion in sales, the NFT market has experienced an 80% drop in trading volumes since March 2022. However, a recent report from crypto data firm DappRadar suggests a glimmer of hope, with the NFT market recording its first month of gains in over a year, posting a $99 million increase month-over-month in October.\nCoatue Management’s substantial markdown of its investment in OpenSea highlights the challenges and adjustments faced by the NFT sector in a changing market landscape. As OpenSea strives to adapt and revamp its platform, the broader NFT industry continues to navigate the complexities of evolving trends and investor sentiment.\n"

This resurgence is partly credited to a hefty transaction involving a CryptoPunks NFT by Wylie “Gordon Goner” Aronow, Bored Ape Yacht Club co-founder. Aronow acquired CryptoPunk #7458 for a staggering 600 ETH, equivalent to $1.1 million. CryptoPunks sales alone brought in $3.6 million, with this seven-figure deal leading the charge.\nMoreover, the market witnessed this upswing alongside a ripple effect from a satirical segment on NFTs by “The Simpsons.” This episode, while poking fun at the NFT craze, seems to have indirectly spurred the creation and sale of related knockoff collections.\nAdditionally, October had already set a positive precedent with a 32% rise in sales from the previous month. The current peak in trading volume surpasses any single day’s activity of that month, suggesting a sustained interest in the digital collectibles market.\nHowever, despite the recent spike, the market is yet to match the frenzied heights of April 2022, when weekly volumes hit $1.4 billion. Last week’s figures stood at just $98 million, highlighting the fluctuating nature of the NFT space.\n\nThe trading landscape has also shifted, with Blur overtaking OpenSea as the dominant marketplace, capturing 73% of the total NFT trading volume by October’s end. This shift may stem from Blur’s strategy of incentivizing traders with the prospect of BLUR token airdrops, which has attracted controversy and increased platform activity.\nHence, while “The Simpsons” might have brought NFTs to a broader audience, the core trading community appears consistent, with few new entrants to the space. This aligns with Punk9059’s observations on the number of unique wallets involved in Ethereum-based NFT purchases, which only saw a significant increase after the show aired.\nWhile the NFT market has experienced a notable spike in trading volume, the long-term sustainability of this trend remains to be seen, with market dynamics constantly in flux.\n"

This surge in activity underscores the collection’s swift ascension to prominence, a feat that aligns with the buoyant and often unpredictable nature of the NFT marketplace.\nAdditionally, this upswing in interest aligns with a recent “The Simpsons” episode that poked fun at the NFT craze, offering an inadvertent nod to various existing NFT collections, including notable mentions of Beeple’s Everyday and the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The animated series’ take on digital collectibles has only fueled the fire for NFT aficionados and collectors.\nOther collections drawing from the same well of inspiration, such as “SimpsPunks,” have vied for attention on OpenSea, further validating the immense draw of “The Simpsons” influence. “The Chimpsons Official” collection, although not new, having been established last September, also enjoyed a spike in visibility following the episode, with its floor price experiencing a significant overnight hike.\nThe appeal of Springfield Punks is evident in the trading volume, with a reported 1,311 ETH worth of transactions, highlighting the market’s appetite for themed digital assets. As the collection finds its place in the market, the floor price reflects a healthy interest, with the lowest-priced NFTs commanding just under 0.11 ETH.\nDespite the unofficial status of Springfield Punks and the absence of an official “The Simpsons” NFT release to coincide with the show’s latest “Treehouse of Horror” installment, Disney has previously dabbled in the arena. In 2021, Disney released “The Simpsons” NFTs on the VeVe marketplace to mark the launch of Disney.\nThe rapid rise of Springfield Punks offers a clear signal of the ongoing enthusiasm for NFTs that combine recognizable pop culture elements with the digital art form.

This event also showcases the powerful influence of mainstream media on the burgeoning NFT market, with “The Simpsons” catalyzing the latest trend.\nWhile the future of Springfield Punks in the volatile NFT market remains to be seen, its explosive entrance serves as a testament to the genre’s capacity for swift ascents to fame and fortune. With a community eagerly watching, Springfield Punks has etched its place in the digital realm, awaiting its next move in a space that thrives on innovation and nostalgia alike.\n"

Salihu, known by his handle NGBxShpend, was scrutinized as the objectionable content of his personal Twitter account went viral, leading to his departure from the company known for spearheading the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC).\nSalihu expressed regret over the situation via a tweet on Sunday, acknowledging that his previous statements had become a source of distraction and conflict. He asserted that his past tweets do not represent his beliefs or values. While confirming Salihu’s resignation, Yuga Labs opted not to comment further on the events. Attempts to reach Salihu for a statement have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nThe ripple effects of this incident coincided with ApeFest, an annual event celebrating BAYC members, which unfolded in Hong Kong this year. Yuga Labs also announced its collaboration with Magic Eden on a new Ethereum NFT marketplace. Additionally, some attendees felt discomfort, potentially attributed to UV light overexposure at the venue.\nThis upheaval comes at a critical juncture for Yuga Labs, a company that, since its inception in early 2021, has seen its projects like the Mutant Ape Yacht Club and Otherside contribute significantly to its trading volume, elevating the firm’s stature in the NFT space. Moreover, the company’s previous acquisition of intellectual property from CryptoPunks and Meebits has solidified its market position.\nThe departure of Salihu has incited reactions from the NFT community, with collectors and owners raising concerns about the vetting process for company representatives. The issue casts a new light on the importance of thorough background checks, especially in roles linked directly to public engagement and brand image.\nFurthermore, this isn’t the first time Yuga Labs has faced accusations related to insensitive imagery.

The marketplace will not alter the trading experience for users, maintaining ease of use without the requirement for additional verification processes like KYC checks.\n\nThe shift in Magic Eden’s policy is a response to the more significant market trend where established players like OpenSea have retreated from enforcing royalties, sparking controversy among creators who rely on these fees for continued revenue.\nMoreover, the marketplace’s decision is not just about immediate benefits but also sets a precedent for the future treatment of creators. Other NFT platforms are invited to adopt the new contract standards, which could pave the way for industry-wide adoption.\nYuga Labs, known for the popular Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, has been vocal in its criticism of platforms that neglect creator royalties. With this new venture, Yuga Labs emphasizes protecting creators’ rights. Daniel Alegre, Yuga Labs CEO, highlighted the importance of standing up for content creators in the ever-shifting digital landscape.\nThe partnership between Yuga Labs and Magic Eden is a beacon for creators seeking respect and acknowledgment in the NFT marketplace. It demonstrates a clear path forward for implementing a fair and sustainable model for creator compensation in the digital realm.\n"

This decisive action, revealed on Friday, marks a significant restructuring for the NFT marketplace, which previously enjoyed a leading position during the industry’s peak trading periods.\nOpenSea has taken this step to streamline operations, ensuring the platform can evolve at the pace demanded by the current NFT space. “Today, we are making significant organizational and operating changes as we focus on building a more nimble—and ultimately better—version of OpenSea,” a spokesperson shared. This move is seen as a preparation for “OpenSea 2.0,” a comprehensive upgrade touted to enhance the platform’s technology, reliability, and user experience.\nCEO Devin Finzer expressed that the marketplace aims to reclaim its position as an innovator rather than a follower. OpenSea’s future plans involve accelerating development to make more impactful decisions that resonate with the community.\n\nAffected employees are receiving a support package that includes four months of severance, continued health benefits for six months, and an expedited schedule for equity vesting. OpenSea’s approach to the layoffs reflects an understanding of the current challenging climate, offering a buffer for those impacted.\nThe NFT market, once buoyant, has felt the pinch of the broader cryptocurrency market downturn. OpenSea faced competitive pressures, especially from Blur, which recently took the lead in trading volume, although OpenSea still maintains a larger trader base.\nThese developments follow a previous reduction in July 2022, when the company addressed economic uncertainties by downsizing by 20%. Despite the cutbacks, OpenSea had sustained a robust trading activity with over 32,000 unique wallets engaging on its platforms over the past week, even as it adjusts its course in response to market shifts.\nOpenSea’s commitment to maintaining its royalty policy amidst industry-wide changes has been a balancing act, reflecting its dedication to creators’ interests. The company continues to navigate the complexities of the evolving NFT ecosystem, aligning its structure and strategy to serve its community effectively.\nThe marketplace’s recalibration comes as a pragmatic response to the changing dynamics of the digital assets sphere. With a flatter organization and a concentrated vision, OpenSea is charting a course for resilience and adaptability in an unpredictable sector.\n"

    "content": "In a striking display of the digital collectibles market’s vitality, an NFT of NBA rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama eclipsed the sale figures for his physical trading cards. The digital asset, crafted by Sorare NBA and tied to the San Antonio Spurs’ number one draft pick, changed hands for a formidable 61.182 ETH, translating to approximately $110,120. This transaction outpaced the previous record for a Wembanyama trading card by a significant margin, with the physical version selling for $67,333 earlier in August.\nSorare NBA’s unique offering merges the realm of sports fandom with the burgeoning technology of NFTs, allowing enthusiasts to possess and utilize these digital assets within their fantasy sports engagements. The purchase underscores Wembanyama’s rapidly growing stature within the basketball community and accentuates the shifting paradigms of collectibility in the digital age.\nMoreover, selling Wembanyama’s NFT relieves Sorare’s platform’s escalating trajectory. Since its inception in 2019, Sorare has introduced an innovative fantasy soccer game and expanded its purview to include partnerships with the NBA and Major League Baseball. Such alliances have borne fruit, with Sorare’s ventures yielding over $713 million in NFT sales. The platform’s valuation soared following a $680 million Series B funding round in 2021, cementing its position in the digital collectibles arena.\n\nAdditionally, the record-breaking sale of the Wembanyama NFT comes on the heels of another notable transaction within Sorare NBA. A digital token of Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Milwaukee Bucks’ marquee player, fetched a handsome 113.9 ETH, or about $187,000 at the time, setting a precedent in February.\nThe burgeoning interest in NFTs, particularly those merging real-world talents with digital ownership, highlights a nuanced shift in collectible culture. These assets promise more than mere possession; they offer utility in virtual games, rewards, and an immutable record of ownership. Sorare’s strategic maneuvers within this niche appear increasingly astute, with the digital sports collectible market gaining momentum.\nConcluding the discourse on this digital sports memorabilia milestone, the Wembanyama NFT’s notable auction results cement the convergence of sports, technology, and investment, marking another chapter in the evolution of sports fandom and digital collectibles.\n"

    "content": "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and owner of Twitter, recently commented on the potential vulnerabilities surrounding non-fungible tokens (NFTs) during his appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast. Musk highlighted the issue and stated that many NFTs link to artwork on external servers. Consequently, he suggested that owners might lose their related artwork if such hosting companies go out of business.\nPodcast with the great and powerful @elonmusk #ad Full episode is 2 hours and 41 minutes, first 2 hours is available here on https://t.co/AIkGSaxVMA pic.twitter.com/DQh0GGNyaO\n— Joe Rogan (@joerogan) October 31, 2023\n\nHowever, not all NFTs face this issue. Projects on Ethereum, the leading blockchain network for NFTs, sometimes store their artwork directly on-chain. Notably, platforms like Art Blocks ensure their artists’ algorithms are on-chain. Hence, the art produced can be recreated from the output. Additionally, NFTs don’t always represent digital art. They can act as proof of ownership for items ranging from digital creations to tangible objects, like wristwatches.\nSignificantly, there’s one NFT-style ecosystem that guarantees whole on-chain artwork storage: Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol. Through this, users can inscribe media or artwork directly onto the blockchain, linking it to a single satoshi, the smallest Bitcoin unit. This ensures the permanent recording of assets on the blockchain. As long as the Bitcoin network remains active, these assets endure.\nBitcoin enthusiasts and supporters of the Ordinals swiftly reacted to Musk’s comments. Will Clemente, co-founder of Reflexivity Research, pointed out that around 38 million inscriptions are currently on the Bitcoin blockchain. Rohun “Frank” Vora, a prominent figure in the NFT space, emphasized how the Ordinals model addresses NFT criticisms. Moreover, Dogecoin co-creator Billy Markus supported Musk’s stance, highlighting his preference for Ordinals over conventional NFTs.\nIn a move that captured the essence of Musk’s message, Leonidas, a prominent supporter of Ordinals, has inscribed the Musk video segment onto Bitcoin. His action emphasized the capability and resilience of the fully on-chain Ordinals, further endorsing its merits.\nWhile Musk’s comments have sparked debate, they’ve also brought attention to the continuous innovations in blockchain and NFTs. Bitcoin’s Ordinals protocol is a potential solution to some concerns raised about off-chain storage of NFT-linked media.\n"

This innovative feature emphasizes user-friendly attributes, aiming to bring more individuals into NFTs. Now, transforming cherished personal experiences into digital assets is a swift process, bypassing the once-necessary intricate grasp of blockchain technology. \nMoreover, this innovation has its challenges. The ease of minting might lead to an influx of NFTs on the Solana (SOL) blockchain, leading to potential concerns about blockchain expansion. Sustainability, especially from an environmental standpoint, is now under the spotlight.\nThe sentimental attachment to these new NFTs also introduces a novel dimension to their value. As personal experiences become tradable commodities, the distinction between emotional and market value might become hazier. This nuance could lead to some misconceptions about the actual worth of such assets.\n\nSignificantly, the erratic tendencies of the NFT market can lead to rapid value shifts. Such fluctuations might surprise those new to this realm, especially if they need to be privy to the market dynamics. \nHowever, Phantom has yet to focus on minting merely. Their platform’s reward system is structured to boost user interactions with Camera Mint. While such a tactic might increase user engagement, a potential pitfall is the inadvertent promotion of quantity over quality. Hence, Phantom is on the clock to ensure its platform remains a hub for content of unerring quality.\nFurthermore, the user experience is enriched with features like an integrated display for minted NFTs under the ‘collectibles’ tab. But there’s room for improvement. Offering in-depth information about NFTs, blockchain intricacies, and potential digital asset risks can pave the way for a well-informed user community.\nPhantom’s Camera Mint feature is a noteworthy addition to the NFT space, making the creation process more accessible. However, with opportunities come challenges that the company must address to ensure long-term success and user satisfaction. Only time will reveal the real impact of this feature in the rapidly advancing digital collectible landscape.\n"

Beginning October 26 at 3:00 p.m. UTC and running for a mere 48 hours, the online art store allows enthusiasts to obtain tangible prints of their digital art.\nHence, two distinctive versions of these iconic pieces are on the menu at Avante Art. The first, named “Punk-On-Chain,” allows each CryptoPunk NFT owner to commission a physical print. However, proving ownership is essential before one can request a print. This strategic move ensures exclusivity, as those without the on-chain version can’t acquire its physical counterpart.\n\nAdditionally, Avante Art is presenting the “10,000 On-Chain” collection. This set comprises prints of all 10,000 CryptoPunks and is available to all, regardless of ownership status. It’s worth noting the tangible differences between these collections. The 10,000 On-Chain artworks are crafted as Archival pigment prints with a silkscreen varnish seal. Conversely, the Punks-On-Chain prints utilize UV pigment techniques with white underpins. Both editions, however, come adorned with a Yuga Labs holographic sticker, affirming their authenticity.\nMoreover, the Punks-On-Chain prints have a unique feature: a QR code on the back. This code is a gateway to a digital Certificate of Authenticity (CoA) on the blockchain. The 10,000 On-Chain pieces, on the other hand, include a physical CoA. This document houses a QR code, which, unlike the former, is not on the print but leads to the digital certificate.\nSignificantly, the genesis of CryptoPunks can be traced back to June 2017, courtesy of Larva Labs. These algorithmically generated art pieces, initially free for Ethereum network users to mint, have seen exponential appreciation. Currently, the starting price for a single CryptoPunk is around $78,000. The entire collection’s market cap stands impressively over $782 million, as per Coingecko data. It’s also noteworthy that Yuga Labs acquired CryptoPunks copyrights from Larva Labs in March 2022.\nAvante Art’s collaboration with Yuga Labs bridges the digital and physical realms, offering a fresh perspective on the rapidly evolving NFT market. This limited-time event celebrates the nostalgic beginnings of CryptoPunks and their undeniable present-day value.\n"

    "content": "In a significant turn, California’s U.S. District Judge ruled in favour of Yuga Labs, the mastermind behind the well-known Bored Ape Yacht Club. The judge ordered Ryder Ripps and Jeremy Cahen to pay $1.5 million for infringing on Yuga Labs’ trademark rights. The profits Ripps and Cahen made from their counterfeit “Ryder Ripps Bored Ape Yacht Club” led to this judgment.\nBesides the monetary damages, the judge imposed an additional penalty. The duo must stop all NFT sales and hand over their online blockchain assets. The court’s decision also emphasized the illegitimacy of Ripps and Cahen’s argument. They previously claimed their version was merely “satire” and “parody” of the original Bored Ape Yacht Club rather than a direct infringement.\nMoreover, the judge has granted Yuga Labs $200,000 in damages concerning cybersquatting violations. Cybersquatting involves registering a renowned brand or company’s domain name to sell it later for a profit. In this case, the domains rrbayc.com and apemarket.com were the culprits. The court observed, “Defendants only had an interest in the domain name to divert potential customers of Yuga Labs to their commercial website.”\nHowever, the court didn’t stop there; they rejected the defendants’ counterclaim, which accused Yuga Labs of using offensive imagery in their Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs. The court highlighted that Yuga Labs, despite having unregistered BAYC Marks, still possessed the rights to those marks. Consequently, these marks are valid and protectable.\nThe timing of domain registrations by Ripps and Cahen was another point of contention. The pair registered their domains post the launch of Yuga Labs’ Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, further cementing the infringement case against them.\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club started in April 2021 and is a collection of 10,000 unique NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. Holders of these NFTs not only join an exclusive community and gain unlimited copyright for media or design usage. Such is the craze that Seth Green, the renowned Family Guy star, spent a hefty $300,000 to reclaim his Bored Ape NFT after a phishing incident.\n"

    "content": "Maison Margiela, the renowned Parisian fashion house, has ventured into the Web3 space, launching a captivating blockchain-based game termed “Numbers.” Drawing inspiration from its iconic 0-23 numbering system, which represents its 23 distinct collections, this Web3 experience is reminiscent of “blockchain bingo.”\nPlayers will compete over the next few weeks to mint all 24 token-linked digits. The reward? A coveted spot in Maison Margiela’s evolving Web3 community. Significantly, as the numbers increase, their rarity does too. For instance, while a whopping 15,000 zeros are available, there are only 742 of the number 23s. A circle highlights the number currently up for grabs, while those fully minted appear in black. The game reaches its climax when the first 100 players have minted all 24 numbers or at Maison Margiela’s discretion.\nBesides the game’s intriguing concept, its fairness makes it stand out. These ERC-1155 tokens, minted on the Polygon network, are unique in that they’re soul-bound. Consequently, they are non-transferable, and each wallet can only mint one of each number. Additionally, minting comes at no gas fee to ensure a level playing field, and every user receives the same gas allocation for each transaction. Hence, while early birds might have a slight advantage, the game fundamentally rewards perseverance and strategic insight.\nMoreover, Margiela’s foray into gamified minting is timely and astute. While the NFT market has seen a recent dip, the gaming industry continues its robust growth. According to IPSOS, gaming, currently valued at $385 billion, is projected to soar to over $522 billion by 2027.\nThe symbolism isn’t lost on those familiar with Maison Margiela’s heritage. Every physical item from the fashion house comes with a tag numbered 0-23. The circled number corresponds to the collection to which the piece belongs. Furthermore, Martin Margiela’s preference for collective statements over personal appearances in the brand’s early days resonates with the decentralized ethos of Web3.\nThis isn’t the brand’s first brush with technology, either. Earlier this year, they incorporated on-chain certificates of authenticity, accessible via NFC chips, in their signature Tabi footwear. In conclusion, Maison Margiela’s innovative blend of fashion and technology signifies a promising fusion of the past and the future, bridging the gap between traditional luxury and the digital frontier.\n"

While these NFTs don’t impede transactions, they act as a constant reminder to all parties involved. Exchanges and potential trading partners will be notified of the wallets’ questionable history. Moreover, this creative use of technology doesn’t stop at the warning. The NFTs, produced by Singapore’s Mintable studio, are designed to aid in tracking any funds that depart from these wallets.\nHowever, these measures didn’t come out of the blue. iSanctuary was roped in by an entrepreneur who faced the misfortune of losing $3 million in cryptocurrency assets. With the melding of on-chain and off-chain evidence, iSanctuary was able to pin down the stolen funds. Presented before the Singapore High Court, their findings were instrumental in securing the unprecedented injunction.\nBesides the core details, iSanctuary has maintained discretion regarding the facts of the case. Still, it’s evident that Mintology, an application by Mintable, played a role in crafting these unique NFTs. Additionally, Zach Burks, the founder of Mintable, gave an indirect nod to their involvement in a recent post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\nWhile the story unfolds, The Straits Times sheds light on a few elements. The case pivots around a stolen private key, indicating compromised security. Singapore-based crypto exchanges have been implicated in laundering the stolen money, with fraudulent actors alleged to be Singaporeans. Furthermore, the scope of this incident is vast, involving nations from Singapore to Spain, Ireland, Britain, and various European countries.\nThis landmark decision by the Singapore High Court marks a shift in how legal jurisdictions may approach the intricacies of digital assets.

The decision, however, hasn’t resonated well with everyone, as 77 members opposed its adoption.\nThe legislation, coined as the “Jonum regime” for games with monetizable digital objects, delicately balances the scales between stimulating French startup innovation and fortifying user safety. With this enactment, a clear legal distinction is drawn for Jonum, distinguishing it from conventional video games and gambling.\nKarima Lachgar, the CEO of Olky Wallet, noted the potential of SREN to lend credibility to a rapidly evolving sector, which has, in the past, been marred by scams. But the journey isn’t over. The legislation awaits scrutiny from the Constitutional Council, which possesses the power to either endorse or dismiss it. This is a turn of events some assembly members eagerly anticipate.\nInterestingly, critics argue the law may inadvertently favor crypto games over online casinos. Karima Lachgar, reflecting on the implications, hinted at the likelihood of betting platforms transitioning to the play-to-earn and Web3 domain, much like the state-run Pari Mutuel Urbain. The latter has already made inroads into the crypto realm with its fantasy horse racing game, Stables.\nHistorically, French regulators believed that assets in crypto games fulfilled most criteria defining gambling. This put popular games, like Sorare and Stables, in jeopardy of being categorized as gambling ventures. Such classification brings with it hefty tax implications. Under the new law, however, the onus of ensuring compliance falls on the Autorité Nationale des Jeux (ANJ), the French National Gambling authority. Consequently, crypto game platforms will mandate age declaration during account creation and ascertain player identity upon in-game earnings withdrawals. Notably, initial registration won’t demand identity verification.\nMoreover, the Jonum regime offers clarity on promotional strategies involving Web3 games and influencers. The directive explicitly bans the engagement of influencers for campaigns on platforms accessible to minors. This implies that popular platforms like YouTube might still be in the clear for promotional activities.\n"

This series will highlight several digital and physical pieces by Rockwell. Additionally, it offers insights into previously unseen images and behind-the-scenes material from the extensive Rockwell archives.\nIconic, a platform that merges traditional art with modern tech trends, facilitated this groundbreaking move. Their recent partnership with the Jackson Pollock Studio, which centered on releasing an NFT collection on the Ethereum network, showcases their expertise.\nArt lovers and collectors must wait a while.

Upon release, those interested can buy these NFTs with a credit card or Ethereum, though the precise pricing for each piece.\nBeyond its digital appeal, this project also supports a worthy cause. The Rockwell Museum will use the proceeds from the NFT sales to advance its mission. It involves increasing public access to Rockwell’s iconic works, nurturing emerging illustrators, and upholding the artist’s rich heritage under the stewardship of the Rockwell Family.\nSpanning much of the last century, Norman Rockwell’s artistry vividly portrayed American life and values. His beloved illustrations depict a mosaic of daily experiences. “Studio Sessions” aims to showcase these moments specifically, looking into the preliminary sketches, photography sessions, and studies that led to each masterpiece. Moreover, each NFT purchase comes with a limited-edition museum-quality print.\nThe director of the Rockwell Museum, Norton Moffatt, conveyed the museum’s excitement, stating, “Our move into digital art editions marks a pivotal point in our pledge to uphold and honor Norman Rockwell’s legacy.

This group comprises major players from the blockchain, NFT, and metaverse sectors.\nCreator royalties—fees ranging from 2.5% to 10%—are added to secondary NFT sales. These fees are directed towards the original creators. However, the changing market dynamics have threatened the consistent application of these royalties. A few NFT marketplaces began removing these fees in an effort to attract more users. Consequently, the successful implementation of this tactic caused significant shifts in platform dominance within the NFT marketplace.\nAdditionally, OMA3 participants view this change as a risk, not only to the NFT space but to the ultimate goal of metaverse development. They believe in a metaverse where users have true digital ownership, enabling virtual items to move effortlessly between platforms.\nRobby Yung, the CEO of Animoca Brands and co-founder of OMA3, emphasized the significance of creator royalties. He believes that without the promise of future royalty benefits, creators might be hesitant to share their content. His vision is for a more democratic, transparent, and fair online ecosystem than what currently exists.\nHowever, Yung acknowledges a challenge. Many current NFT purchasers seem to be more focused on immediate financial gains rather than considering the broader implications for the digital community.\nThe OMA3 working group, featuring Animoca, Yuga Labs, Magic Eden, and others like Decentraland, aims to establish protective measures for these royalties. They hope to introduce universal standards for NFT marketplaces, ensuring these fees are upheld.\nMike Seavers, the CTO of Yuga Labs, expressed Yuga’s commitment to a fair and interoperable Web3 environment. They’re dedicated to working alongside OMA3 in setting the standards for success.\nMoreover, some renowned NFT brands, in response to platforms like OpenSea halting creator royalty enforcement, have considered limiting their association. Yuga Labs, for example, considered ending its NFT brand compatibility with OpenSea after it ceased enforcement of royalties.\nTo conclude, the digital landscape is evolving, and the need to protect creator royalties is more pressing than ever. OMA3’s initiative, backed by industry heavyweights, aims to restore balance and ensure fairness within the NFT marketplace.\n"

The duo’s defense, led by esteemed attorney Thomas Sprankling of the WilmerHale firm, seemed unable to sway the Ninth District U.S. Court of Appeals judges in an October 17 hearing.\nMoreover, the crux of the defense revolved around the controversial Bored Ape NFTs. Sprinkling asserted that these NFTs, supposedly imitating the original Yuga Labs collection, served as a protest against hidden anti-Semitic imagery. By positioning Ripps and Cahen’s sales as avant-garde, the attorney emphasized the boundaries of speech they intended to push.\nAdditionally, Sprinkling referred to the anti-SLAPP statute in California, which aims to halt lawsuits that intimidate and suppress free speech. He told the panel that the statute is a safeguard, ensuring no speech-chilling threats arise from legal proceedings. Furthermore, the defense motion under anti-SLAPP highlighted their belief that Yuga Labs initiated the lawsuit merely to stifle their protest art and inundate them with exorbitant legal fees.\nHowever, the judges focused on the NFT sales rather than the proclaimed artistic intent. In a poignant moment, Judge Anthony Johnstone remarked, “He was selling the same images, on the same marketplaces, on virtually indistinguishable NFT identifiers.” Echoing a similar sentiment, Judge Morgan Christen voiced her confusion, indicating that the defense’s argument failed to resonate with the bench.\nIn conclusion, while the artist’s intentions might be rooted in pushing the boundaries of expression, the court’s focus seems firmly on sales and potential infringement. As the case progresses, how this interpretation shapes the final judgment remains to be seen.\n"

Significantly, they’ve called upon the government to align with NFT marketplaces in combating copyright infringements.\nInitiating their inquiry in November 2022, the committee delved deeply into the blockchain and NFT world. NFTs, especially those showcasing art, have been identified as potential pitfalls, inadvertently infringing on the intellectual rights of artists. Moreover, the committee found that these violations often occur on platforms with little to no avenues for redress.\nCaroline Dinenage, Conservative MP and Chair of the CMS Committee, remarked on the severity of the issue. She emphasized that artists are increasingly vulnerable, with their creations being appropriated and promoted without consent. Additionally, the convoluted advertising realm only adds layers of complexity, posing risks for both artists and investors.\nHowever, the challenges don’t end with mere copyright. The report also spotlighted the precarious situation artists face when their creations are misattributed. Such misrepresentations can jeopardize an artist’s future earning potential. Consequently, the committee believes that clear rules need to be set for online platforms, including NFT marketplaces, to protect everyone involved from fraudulent or illegal content.\nAnother intriguing aspect the committee touched upon is the intersection of NFTs and sports. Fan tokens have emerged as tools to enhance fan engagement with their favorite teams. Buyers of these tokens receive perks, rewards, and exclusive interactions. Yet, the committee remains skeptical. They believe that the volatile nature of these tokens makes them an unreliable metric of genuine fan engagement. Additionally, the report warned that these speculative ventures could harm both the fans financially and the clubs’ reputation.\nMoreover, deceptive NFT advertising is on the committee’s radar. They advocate for a robust regulatory framework to oversee the advertising process, ensuring that consumers are shielded from potential harm. It’s worth noting that current UK regulations compel crypto firms to ensure their ads are clear, and fair, and carry prominent risk disclaimers.\n"

This dynamic creation has drawn numerous visitors to the MoMA lobby, which will remain on display until October 29.\nDespite the admiration from many, the artwork has sparked debates. Significantly, discussions have arisen about the role of AI in art creation and how museums should categorize such contemporary pieces. Noted art critic Jerry Saltz has described Anadol’s masterpiece as a “glorified lava lamp,” emphasizing the polarized reactions the piece has garnered.\nMoreover, Anadol, in a recent tweet, highlighted that “Unsupervised” stands as the “first generative AI and tokenized artwork” to grace MoMA’s collection. Besides its AI accolades, “Unsupervised” has stepped into the realm of digital assets. Anadol has minted an accompanying Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collection for the piece. Additionally, museum visitors can mint a free NFT as a token of their experience by scanning a QR code near the artwork.\n\nBeyond “Unsupervised,” MoMA has expanded its digital art portfolio. Recently, the museum acquired “3FACE” by American contemporary artist Ian Cheng. This unique artwork utilizes on-chain wallet data to represent participant personalities visually. To emphasize its commitment to the digital and blockchain sphere, MoMA launched an interactive project named “MoMA Postcard.”\nIn a statement, MoMA expressed its dedication to supporting artists who explore emerging technologies.

This contractor, be it Chinese or foreign, must be proficient in the domain of blockchain.\nMoreover, to ensure a seamless experience for users, the platform’s underlying blockchain mainnet must be robust. It should be able to effortlessly handle over 10,000 transactions every second. Hence, potential contractors have their work cut out for them, given the tight timeline. They have until October 17 to submit their applications and a mere three months thereafter to materialize their proposed design.\nThe overarching goal for this venture is noble China Daily aims to amplify the global influence of Chinese civilization. To achieve this, the platform will harness a medley of advanced technologies. Besides blockchain and NFTs, the platform will leverage the metaverse, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, big data, and cloud computing. All these technologies combined aim to provide users with an immersive experience that resonates with the essence of Chinese civilization.\nAdditionally, developers have outlined some critical specifications for the platform. It must be versatile enough to handle the uploading, showcasing, and management of a myriad of digital collections. This includes supporting different multimedia forms and a variety of collection types. Moreover, the platform should be equipped with functions for pricing, bidding, and running limited-time events. The integration of multi-currency settlement is yet another essential feature.\nHowever, China Daily doesn’t intend to restrict its NFT collections to its own platform. In its quest for a wider reach, the newspaper plans to collaborate with some of the most renowned international NFT platforms. OpenSea, Rarible, SuperRare, and Foundation are among the potential candidates for this collaboration.\nConsequently, this move is particularly intriguing given China’s stance on cryptocurrencies. Since 2021, all forms of cryptocurrency transactions have been outlawed in the country. Nevertheless, a few blockchain entities continue to function, albeit under the watchful eye of law enforcement.\n"

    "content": "In a recent development, Lucky Star Currency (LSC), an astrology-themed nonfungible token (NFT) initiative, has reportedly executed an exit scam, siphoning over $1 million. This revelation comes from a detailed report by blockchain security firm CertiK.\nLSC, which claims its foundation by astrologists, primarily targeted the Chinese crypto investment market. The project’s unique selling point revolved around its NFTs, with its contracts encompassing an Award Center and an NFT Marketplace. However, the project’s credibility hit when its deployer account activated the “withdrawToken” function. This action drained over $1 million in LSC from the NFTMerge and AdwardCenter contracts. The extracted tokens were subsequently exchanged for the Binance USD (BUSD) stablecoin and transferred to a separate account.\n\nMoreover, the project’s promotional activities were notably visible on the Chinese news app Toutiao and the Q\u0026A platform Zhihu. However, as of October 9, attempts to access the project’s website and user interface have been futile, with both platforms going offline.\nDelving deeper into the transactions, at approximately 02:52 a.m. UTC, a BNB Smart Chain address removed a staggering 1.6 million LSC from the AwardCenter contract. A subsequent transaction drained an additional 1.4 million LSC from the NFTMerge contract. These funds were swiftly converted into over $1 million in BUSD via PancakeSwap. The converted amount was then sent to an account that has, interestingly, been on the receiving end of BUSD from various sources for the past 82 days. This pattern suggests the possibility of multiple scams funneling money into this account.\nCertiK’s analysis further confirms that the contracts in question were indeed listed on Telegram as the project’s official contracts. Additionally, blockchain data indicates that the account responsible for the withdrawal is the deployer for the AwardCenter contract.\nExit scams, especially from Chinese projects, have unfortunately become a recurring issue in the Web3 domain. The legal landscape in China, which deems running a centralized cryptocurrency exchange illegal, further complicates matters. Consequently, users who invest in Chinese protocols with centralized components might risk their funds being seized by authorities.\nIn a similar incident in July, the China-based Multichain protocol witnessed a massive over $100 million drain into an attacker’s account. While the team has reported the arrest of their CEO, the victims remain in the dark, seeking clarity on the whereabouts of their investments.\n"

    "content": "The NFT market, a recent acquisition of CrypToadz #4030 on the OpenSea platform, has raised eyebrows and ignited intense speculation. The eye-catching transaction saw the NFT changing hands for a staggering $1.6 million, equivalent to 1,055 Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) and an additional fee of nearly $42,000 worth of ETH. This acquisition has left many in the crypto community puzzled, given the current dip in NFT demand.\nTypically, CrypToadz NFTs start at a modest 0.53 ETH, approximately $835, on OpenSea, with the highest listed offer for this specific NFT hovering around 0.6 ETH, roughly $940. The significant premium paid for this profile picture (PFP) project has spurred initial reactions on Crypto Twitter, with some speculating the possibility of a “fat finger” mistake. In this scenario, the buyer unintentionally overspent in a hurried transaction.\n\nHowever, a deeper investigation uncovers a more intriguing explanation: wash trading. The wallet responsible for the CrypToadz NFT purchase had recently received approximately 1,116 ETH (approximately $1.76 million) from another wallet. Notably, in September, this second wallet received around 1,200 ETH (almost $1.9 million) from Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixing service.\nTornado Cash functions as an automated service designed to obscure the flow of cryptocurrency between wallets by blending funds from various users into a common pool. This process disrupts cryptocurrency’s transparent, on-chain movement, making it challenging to trace ETH’s movement.\nWhile privacy advocates argue that Tornado Cash offers a level of cryptocurrency transaction privacy, authorities view such tools as potential facilitators of money laundering. Consequently, Tornado Cash was banned in the United States following Treasury Department sanctions in 2022.\nThe use of Tornado Cash to funnel a substantial amount of ETH into the wallet responsible for the CrypToadz NFT purchase raises questions about potential wash trading or money laundering activities. The NFT acquisition was likely utilized to complicate further the flow of funds across cryptocurrency wallets and assets. However, it’s important to emphasize that using Tornado Cash does not inherently imply illicit activity or intent.\n"

The alliance seeks to instill confidence among consumers and stakeholders by providing verifiable certificates of authenticity (COAs) for a substantial batch of cannabis, magic mushrooms, and kratom products, all earmarked for medicinal applications.\n\nBlockticity, with its innovative approach, aims to mitigate the prevalent fraud in the NFT sector. A spokesperson elucidated that the challenge is magnified due to the ineffective tracking of goods across multifaceted supply chains. Consequently, the startup has developed a robust, secure NFT module for the CLIA-licensed laboratory’s products, ensuring higher authenticity and traceability.\n\nMoreover, blockchain technology, particularly Avalanche’s platform, plays a pivotal role in this endeavor. While traditional methods like QR codes and visuals have been employed to authenticate and track approved medical supplements, Blockticity’s solution anchors COAs to Avalanche, providing consistent, verifiable proof. Since blockchain records are immutable, it significantly reduces the potential for fraudulent tampering with the certification.\nAdditionally, these NFTs are connected to a QR code on the physical product and involve meticulous third-party testing. This strategy enhances confidence among medical patients, ensuring they receive ACS Laboratory’s premium products, which are now backed by verifiable, blockchain-anchored data.\nIn the initial issuance of COA NFTs, ACS Laboratory and Blockticity have minted 37,000 tokens. These are securely housed on Avalanche’s C-Chain as non-fungible tokens and are effortlessly traceable via the associated QR code.\nMoreover, the hemp laboratory has outlined plans to broaden the project. An additional 120,000 NFT certificates for cannabis products are slated to be introduced by the year’s end, further expanding the scope and impact of this innovative solution in the medicinal psychedelics and cannabis sectors.\n\nHowever, the implications of this partnership extend beyond mere certification.

He aimed to ensure that the team and projects were in perfect alignment with the company’s objectives.\nHowever, Alegre soon recognized that several projects, despite their good intentions, either stretched the team’s resources or ventured beyond their core expertise. Hence, the decision to streamline operations and focus on what Yuga Labs does best.\nSignificantly, Yuga Labs remains committed to its thriving communities, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club and CryptoPunks. Moreover, the company’s acquisition spree in 2022 saw them take over the Web3 ecosystem WENEW and the flagship NFT collection 10KTF.\nLooking ahead, Yuga Labs is fully invested in its Otherside metaverse strategy. This strategy encompasses gaming, entertainment experiences, and interactive social connections. Additionally, the company is keen on forging new partnerships, reminiscent of its previous collaborations with luxury brand Gucci and social media marketing powerhouse Bad Rhino.\n"

This iconic pixelated NFT collection played a pivotal role in the NFT art boom of 2021. The documentary has been in the works since March 2018, marking a significant endeavor to chronicle the journey of this revolutionary art form.\nCryptoPunks, created by John Watkinson and Matt Hall, has been a significant player in the digital art space. The trailer released by Rabinovitz offers a glimpse into a 2018 interview with the founders and sheds light on the various themes the film is set to explore. In the trailer, Watkinson shares insights into the creation process of the punks’ accessories, highlighting that CryptoPunks was not a finished product at its launch.\nThe documentary delves into the cultural impact of CryptoPunks, exploring its widespread adoption by celebrities, its presence in conferences, and the intrigue it generated in auction houses. It aims to narrate the story of CryptoPunks to a broader audience beyond the crypto-natives, emphasizing its influence and evolution in the digital art landscape.\nIn 2022, Yuga Labs, renowned for the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, acquired the intellectual property of CryptoPunks from Watkinson and Hall. The acquisition came as the founders felt they were not apt for the day-to-day management of such projects. Since April of this year, the floor price of CryptoPunks has been relatively stable, hovering around 45.19 ether (ETH) or approximately $75,000.\nHowever, the documentary by Rabinovitz has yet to have a confirmed release date. It emerges at a time when the initial enthusiasm for NFT-inspired films seems to be waning, with projects like Coinbase’s Bored Apes movie being put on hold and collaborations like Reese Witherspoon’s with World of Women not producing any releases so far.\nAdditionally, Rabinovitz’s work is significant as it strives to bring the CryptoPunks narrative to the mainstream. He noted that while those immersed in the crypto world might be familiar with it, most of the population remains unaware of this digital art phenomenon.\nMoreover, the documentary must maintain an objective reporting style, focusing solely on relevant information without incorporating promotional tones or opinions. It is meticulously crafted to ensure easy readability, avoid complex sentence structures, and maintain a concise and clear approach to delivering information.\n"

This comparison underscores the enhanced capabilities and efficiency this technology brings, exceeding the conventional expectations associated with securitization.\nJohnson’s observations were part of a broader discussion focusing on the prospects of alternative investment vehicles. She emphasized that the influx of available capital and disruptive technological advancements draws more corporations and CEOs towards futuristic investments, such as blockchain technology. Johnson elaborated on the multifaceted benefits of blockchain, stating it facilitates payment mechanisms, enables the integration of smart contracts into tokens, and serves as a reliable general ledger, providing a single source of truth.\nTo illustrate her perspective, Johnson cited the example of renowned singer Rihanna, who recently released one of her hit songs as a nonfungible token (NFT), allowing token holders to earn a share of the streaming royalties. This innovative approach to music distribution and revenue sharing exemplifies the practical applications of tokenization in the entertainment industry.\nMoreover, Johnson pointed out that athletes could leverage tokenization to their advantage by offering tokens representing a percentage of their future revenue streams to their fans. This approach allows fans to benefit financially from their support and exemplifies the versatility of tokenization in various domains.\n\nJohnson, a veteran with over three decades of experience at Franklin Templeton, currently leads the company as its president and CEO. Franklin Templeton, managing assets worth $1.5 trillion, is among the firms awaiting regulatory approval in the United States for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n"

Moreover, these funds are set to support around 4,000 individuals battling cancer and extend a helping hand to locals in dire straits.\nThis occasion saw a gathering of 30 talented artists, highlighting the cohesive strength of the NFT community in ushering in change.

    "hashtag": "Crypto Payments, NFT market, PayPal",
    "content": "PayPal has recently unveiled a patent application promising an innovative structure for non-fungible token transactions. Filed in March and disclosed on September 21, the application presents a framework suggesting a blend of flexibility, user convenience, and broader scope.\nSignificantly, the patent points towards the involvement of an unnamed third-party service provider, with Ethereum being explicitly mentioned. Moreover, the proposed ecosystem hints at the potential of fractionalized NFT purchases. This could lead to introduction of governance tokens that may be traded freely.\nBesides the conventional use of digital collectibles, the patent indicates that the technology could be applied to any form of distinguishable digital data. Such data would then be traceable via a decentralized blockchain ledger.\nAdditionally, the application provides a glimpse into an “omnibus wallet” linked directly to the service provider. In such arrangements, transactions wouldn’t necessitate a record on the blockchain. Consequently, users would be exempt from associated gas fees, marking a stark shift from current standards.\nFurthermore, an intriguing aspect of PayPal’s vision touches on NFT-related royalties as a potential revenue stream. To enhance user experience, the ecosystem could have a third-party handling storage and checkout services. Hence, compliance and risk management might witness streamlining through the designated service provider.\nOn the topic of currency, the application showcases true versatility. Notably, it mentions that any currency could be incorporated into this structure. This flexibility is particularly relevant when considering PayPal’s recent foray into the cryptocurrency space. In August, the financial giant announced the launch of its dollar-backed stablecoin, PayPal USD ($PYUSD). This move was a landmark event, signifying the first instance of a major U.S. financial entity introducing such a digital asset.\nHowever, there are other significant updates from the company. Earlier in August, PayPal’s Board of Directors declared the induction of Alex Chriss, a seasoned Intuit executive, as their new President and CEO. Chriss, who took the helm this month, isn’t new to steering the ship. Having served as Intuit’s Executive Vice President and General Manager for their Small Business and Self-Employed Group since 2019, he played a pivotal role. Responsible for over half of Intuit’s revenue, Chriss spearheaded Mailchimp’s successful $12 billion acquisition in 2021.\n\nThis string of strategic moves by PayPal, from patent applications to top-tier appointments, reveals a company poised for innovation. With the increasing popularity and potential of NFTs, PayPal’s steps towards refining and expanding its transactional structure indicate a vision that’s in tune with the evolving digital landscape.\n"

According to a recent report by DappRadar, a staggering $297 million has been pumped into this niche, with a lion’s share directed toward gaming infrastructure.\nMoreover, July’s statistics reveal a compelling narrative. Blockchain gaming constituted a substantial 41% of all decentralized app (dapp) activities. Consequently, this surge isn’t merely a flash in the pan but indicative of a larger trend.\nVance Spencer, co-founder of Framework Ventures, shed light on the global divide in this arena. He emphasized that while the US leans heavily towards NFTs, culture, and DeFi, Asia emerges as the dominant player in the gaming market. He added, “In gaming, there are essentially no barriers to crafting an engaging crypto game.”\nEchoing Spencer’s sentiments, Michael Anderson, another co-founder at Framework Ventures, shed light on the not-so-distant future. He hinted at a paradigm where games with ownership features would invariably overshadow their traditional counterparts.\nHowever, while the industry shows promise, it’s not without challenges. Scott Sunarto, the dynamic founder and CEO of Argus Labs, voiced concerns at a recent panel discussion at Permissionless II. He highlighted the trend of game studios retrofitting Web2 games with a mere NFT layer. Instead of this superficial approach, Sunarto is an advocate for exploring innovative methods to integrate crypto levers. This, he believes, would elevate Web3 gaming beyond mere collectibles, enhancing its appeal manifold.\nAdditionally, Sunarto touched upon another vital aspect of the gaming world — distribution. He believes gaming providers will lean towards owning their distribution channels. Hence, it’s likely that publishers will drift to their custom chains. Here, they can exert greater control, right from managing gas subsidies to intricate chain-level customizations. Such strategies, Sunarto feels, can not only enhance user experience but also arm game publishers with features that set them apart from competitors.\n"

The collection, which debuted in August 2021, has achieved substantial market presence, with a total volume of 82,902 ETH, equivalent to over $131 million, on OpenSea.\nJohn Duff, Henry Smith, Maxwell Roux, and Bruno Nispel, all associated with Remilia Corporation, have initiated legal proceedings against Krishna Okhandiar, accusing him of misappropriating millions and attempting to monopolize control of the company. This lawsuit, lodged on September 22, follows a separate legal action by Okhandiar earlier in the month. All parties involved have asserted claims to be founders or co-founders of the project.\nThe internal strife within Remilia, once perceived as a DAO, has been simmering since Okhandiar, also known as Charlotte Fang, was unmasked in May 2022 as the individual behind the contentious online alias “Miya.” Despite distancing himself from Remilia and the Milady project and delegating control to Smith and Nispel, tensions flared again when Okhandiar alleged that an unidentified developer had hijacked control of the company’s social media accounts and absconded with $1 million in fees.\n\nIn response, the plaintiffs have alleged that Okhandiar orchestrated their expulsion from Remilia Corporation and failed to honor promises of equity and corporate documentation. They contend that Okhandiar, utilizing his access to the company’s multi-signature wallet, transferred approximately $600,000 worth of digital assets to his personal account and removed an additional $1.7 million from the company’s treasury.\nHowever, Okhandiar’s narrative diverges sharply, asserting his sole founder status since January 2021 and dismissing Duff, Smith, and Roux as independent contractors with no equity in the company. He contends that any financial transactions were legitimate, and the plaintiffs are not entitled to any unpaid salaries or bonuses.\nMoreover, the plaintiffs have revived the year-old “Miya” controversy, highlighting Okhandiar’s alleged history of online antagonism and verbal abuse under various aliases, including Charlotte Fang. Roux has claimed that the working environment was marred by Okhandiar’s abusive and harassing behavior, but the team continued to work on the NFT projects despite the hostile atmosphere.\nIn addition to unpaid wages, the plaintiffs are seeking the establishment of a constructive trust encompassing the assets, funds, and intellectual property related to the NFTs they created. The ongoing legal battle underscores the complexities and challenges emerging in the rapidly evolving NFT space, highlighting the need for clear governance structures and transparent operational practices.\n"

It stands out in the digital asset marketplace, offering a unique service: physical vaulting through Brink’s.\n\nThe sale, aptly named “Stress Test: Break Courtyard.io,” presented a tantalizing offer. For a mere $5.00 USD, buyers could acquire a virtual Pokémon card pack. A chance to obtain pre-disclosed cards, some of which were PSA9 graded cards from 2000, valued at approximately $500.\nHowever, there was a twist. Buyers needed to establish an account and connect via Google. This action seamlessly created a custodial wallet. Additionally, Courtyard ensured that purchasing wasn’t limited to cryptocurrency. They simplified the process, allowing the use of credit cards, much to the delight of Pokémon aficionados.\nAfter securing their digital treasures, there was a brief pause. Courtyard set the stage for the grand reveal, enabling the opening of purchased packs 24 hours later, specifically on Sept. 21. From that point, users could transfer their digital cards off Courtyard and into their personal Polygon wallet.\n\nAn analyst drew parallels between this sale and a “Rollbit-style loot box,” but with a focus on real-world asset collectibles. After securing a pack, buyers had to exhibit patience. They could unveil their cards after a day. However, any packs left unopened would automatically disclose their contents after two days. Significantly, unopened 2000 Base Set booster boxes now command prices exceeding $15,000.\nAdditionally, the liquidity of opening a digital pack online was highlighted by @S4mmy.eth as a significant advantage over opening a physical booster box.\nIn related news, last month saw Polygon surpass Solana (SOL) in activity. This achievement solidified its status as the second most active blockchain for NFT transactions. This surge in popularity might be linked to the SEC’s recent scrutiny of Solana, labeling it and 17 other cryptocurrencies as potential “securities.”\n"

    "content": "Upland, the renowned metaverse platform, has announced an NFT fundraiser. This initiative aims to support KABOOM!, an American nonprofit dedicated to building playgrounds in underserved neighborhoods. Over the past 25 years, KABOOM! has impressively constructed or renovated more than 17,000 playspaces.\nDanny Brown Wolf, Upland’s chief of staff, highlighted that ending playspace inequity deeply resonates with the Upland community. Moreover, it was the Upland community members, termed “avid Uplanders,” who introduced KABOOM! to the platform. Additionally, some of these members have actively participated in real-world fundraisers for the playground manufacturer. Consequently, this collaboration allowed KABOOM! to liaise with the Upland team, paving the way for a metaverse fundraiser using in-game map assets.\nFor those unfamiliar, these map assets in Upland are equivalent to NFTs. Users have the option to purchase assets ranging from land and houses to apartments and decorative items for their virtual spaces. Hence, in line with this concept, Upland is set to launch an NFT playground collection. This collection comprises 1800 NFTs, and the proceeds will directly benefit KABOOM!. However, it’s worth noting that Upland will retain a 10% transaction fee.\nThe minting process, a spectacle for all metaverse participants, will kick off with an in-game representation of a factory producing these playgrounds. This event is scheduled for Thursday, with the first sales commencing on Friday. The collection, showcasing five distinct playground designs, is the brainchild of an Uplander graphic artist. Once acquired, users can seamlessly integrate these playgrounds into their virtual backyards.\nThis isn’t Upland’s maiden charitable venture. In December 2022, the platform collaborated with UNICEF Brazil. The fundraiser aimed to support a youth program focused on imparting metaverse and Web3 skills to aspiring young professionals. This sale featured winter-themed virtual ornaments and gnomes, reflecting Upland’s seasonal dynamics. Additionally, leveraging its partnership with UNICEF, Upland organized a sale in February to assist earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria.\nWolf perceives these fundraisers, especially the UNICEF collaboration, as a testament to the metaverse’s potential. She envisions a future where impact organizations harness the metaverse, akin to how they utilize social media platforms like Facebook for campaigns.\n"

    "content": "The Trademark Office of the China National Intellectual Property Administration (Chinese Trademark Office) has approved several trademark applications associated with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and metaverse services. This decision stands in contrast to China’s previous position, which leaned toward recognizing only standard goods and services.\nHistorically, the Office showed a preference for standard items and services approved in advance for national trademark applications. Additionally, it was slow to integrate new digital and virtual offerings. However, this recent change hints at a more accommodating approach, albeit perhaps temporary. The approvals might act as a precedent before the Office settles on a definitive list of standard digital and virtual goods and services.\nMajor luxury watch brands, including TISSOT, LONGINES, and RADO, are among the first beneficiaries of this decision. They secured registrations for marks directly filed as national applications. Notably, this is encouraging for U.S. companies. The Chinese trademark system doesn’t necessitate actual use before registration. Moreover, a Chinese national registration isn’t contingent on U.S. registration, unlike the stipulations of the Madrid Protocol.\nA closer look at the accepted applications suggests the Office has granted some leeway in descriptions. For instance, Coty’s registration for its nail polish brand, SALLY HANSEN, is particularly detailed. It covers “downloadable computer software for creating, producing, and modifying digital animated and non-animated designs and characters,” a description notably lengthier than typical Chinese registrations.\nHowever, this newfound flexibility might not be permanent. It’s plausible that the Chinese Trademark Office could return to its original stringent requirements. Hence, U.S. applicants must remain vigilant, consulting the list of approved goods and services for their filings.\nThe Chinese government’s intent to promote domestic digital tokens and NFT transaction platforms adds another layer to this development. It’s crucial to determine how and where these marks should be used under Chinese trademark law. This is especially pertinent to avoid potential non-use cancellation challenges.\n"

    "content": "South Korea’s entertainment giant, Dreamus, is venturing into the burgeoning NFT ticketing space. In a strategic move, the firm, a subsidiary of SK Planet, has incorporated NFT ticketing services within the popular OK Cashbag loyalty rewards app. This integration allows ardent fans to purchase tickets for coveted events, including K-pop concerts, as Avalanche NFTs.\nBesides being a reward platform, OK Cashbag boasts many games and quizzes on its Google Play Store app, amassing over 10 million downloads. Significantly, these new NFT ticket services are bolstered by SK Planet’s private Avalanche subnet, unveiled earlier in the year.\nHence, fans can now secure their spots for prominent events like this year’s Seoul Jazz Festival and the acclaimed “Phantom of the Opera” musical using Avalanche-based NFTs. However, while initial offerings included tickets to the K-pop Superpop Festival, an unforeseen mishap during stage setup led to the event’s cancellation, with refunds in the pipeline.\nDreamus, known for its association with prominent K-pop artists like Psy and Twice, hints at more NFT-ticketed K-pop events on the horizon. This adoption of NFTs in ticketing addresses the pressing issue of bots and scalpers that plague the live events industry. Justin Kim, the head of Korea for Ava Labs, emphasized these issues’ negative impacts on artists and fans, making emotions run high.\nBy transitioning tickets onto the blockchain, artists gain the power of customization. Moreover, this move allows artists to determine the reselling capabilities of their tickets or even dictate a cap on the resale prices. Kim highlighted that these features can be tweaked within each NFT collection’s unique smart contract.\nAdditionally, crypto startups worldwide are recognizing the potential of NFT ticketing. Firms such as Sports Illustrated Tickets on the Ethereum scaling network Polygon and Get Protocol on Tezos are all boarding the NFT ticketing train.\nHowever, there’s a unique twist to Dreamus’ NFTs. These won’t be visible like typical NFTs on platforms like OpenSea. They will be exclusively available to the purchaser, preventing potential misuse, as clarified by Kim. Dreamus’ NFT tickets also simplify the authentication process on event days, a factor SK Planet’s Chief Business Officer, Gyosu Kim, believes enhances the overall fan experience.\nOn a concluding note, there’s more in store for NFT enthusiasts. Dreamus and SK Planet are on track to unveil a secondary marketplace for NFTs, enriched with loyalty perks and other features.\n"

    "content": "South Korea’s Upbit exchange has surprisingly become the primary driver behind a sudden 35% surge in the market cap of ImmutableX’s native token, IMX, in the last 24 hours. Significantly, the token has rallied by almost 45% on the weekly charts. Consequently, a 22% increase in trading volumes has followed, reaching $556 million. Most noteworthy is that a staggering 20% of the global trade volume for IMX originates from South Korea’s Upbit exchange.\nIn contrast, Binance’s IMX-Tether trading pair only accounted for 7% of the global trade volume. Hence, this stark disparity lends credibility to the notion that South Korean traders substantially influence ImmutableX’s (IMX) price surge.\n\nAccording to crypto analysis firm LookOnChain, Upbit wallets amassed $9.45 million worth of IMX in three hours. Additionally, CoinGlass data reveals a notable increase in open interest in IMX amid its price surge. The number of open positions skyrocketed by over 700%, now at a remarkable $106 million.\nHowever, the reasoning behind the token’s sudden popularity among South Korean investors remains ambiguous. It is plausible that ImmutableX’s active participation in various global blockchain and web3 gaming events played a pivotal role. The firm recently engaged in significant events like the Animoca Brands investor day in Sydney and the major crypto conference Token 2049 in Singapore. Moreover, it is slated to appear at the Tokyo Game Show 2023 from Sept. 21- Sept. 24, 2023.\nSouth Korea, recognized as a global gaming hub, could be aligned with the platform due to its prolific presence in the gaming sector. The world of web3 gaming is gaining momentum, especially given its resilience during the recent crypto meltdown. The sector sees gaming more as a recreational pursuit than a profit-oriented activity, although the burgeoning play-to-earn model does allow gamers to reap financial rewards. Reports forecast that this industry is poised to experience a multi-billion-dollar surge by the end of this decade.\nImmutableX’s involvement in these high-profile events could catalyze its heightened popularity in South Korea. Besides, the firm’s presence in these prominent gatherings could align well with South Korea’s status as a global gaming nexus.\nEven with the rise, the underlying motivations of South Korean investors and the sustainable trajectory of IMX still need to be fully comprehended. It is essential to continually observe the unfolding market dynamics and the evolving interests of the global trading community in the IMX token and the larger crypto gaming landscape.\n"

    "content": "It has been revealed that a staggering 95% of non-fungible token (NFT) collections have effectively zero value. This revelation, unveiled in a report by dappGambl, underscores the need for a sobering reassessment of the NFT landscape.\nOut of a comprehensive sample of 73,257 NFT collections, a whopping 95% of them registered a market cap of zero ether, as gleaned from data provided by NFT Scan and CoinMarketCap. This translates to an alarming 23 million individuals holding these seemingly worthless digital assets.\nNFTs, those unique digital representations tethered to blockchain technology, with Ethereum being the favored choice, experienced a meteoric rise during the crypto bull run of 2021 and 2022, boasting monthly trading volumes of up to $2.8 billion. High-profile collections like Bored Apes and Cryptopunks commanded millions of dollars in sales, with celebrities like Stephen Curry and Snoop Dogg enthusiastically jumping on the bandwagon.\nHowever, the euphoria that once surrounded NFTs has been mercilessly quashed by dappGambl’s findings. Presently, a staggering 79% of all NFT collections remain unsold, signaling a buyer’s market characterized by a surplus of supply over demand, leaving enthusiasts and investors disenchanted.\nEven when filtering out lower-value projects, a gloomy picture emerges. Among the top 8,850 collections by market cap, 18% are rendered worthless, while 41% hover in the $5-$10 price range. Astonishingly, less than 1% bear a price tag exceeding $6,000—a stark contrast to the million-dollar deals of yesteryears.\nThe study further highlights a glaring disconnect between the listed prices of NFTs and their actual sales. This suggests that many sellers are holding out for a resurgence in NFT interest akin to the 2021 boom—a resurgence that may never materialize again.\n"

Recognizing its potential, Walmart is keen on exploring commerce opportunities within these virtual realms. The company’s recent initiatives include offering identical items for both physical and virtual homes in the popular mobile game House Flip. Additionally, fans of the mobile virtual world Zepeto can now purchase virtual clothing inspired by Walmart’s fashion brand, Scoop.\nThomas Kang, VP \u0026 general manager of metaverse commerce at Store No. 8, Walmart’s innovation hub, shared insights on this venture. He emphasized that the company’s goal isn’t to overshadow reality with the virtual. Instead, it’s about enhancing and connecting both worlds for the customer. Walmart’s strategy revolves around being contextual and authentic, aiming to elevate the overall customer experience.\nA significant advantage for Walmart is its widespread physical presence. The company is uniquely positioned, with nearly 90% of the U.S. population residing within 10 miles of a Walmart store. This proximity allows Walmart to offer exclusive deals, such as gifting virtual items upon purchasing physical goods.\nIn a groundbreaking move, Walmart is set to enable contextual purchases in House Flip. Customers will soon be able to buy physical items without exiting the virtual world. They can conveniently check out using their Walmart account, whether buying virtual, physical, or both goods.\nKang highlighted that this concept is currently unparalleled. He stated, “We are well positioned in that environment because we are a commerce company. We aim to assist brands in selling their products in virtual worlds.”\nForecasts by Citi suggest that by 2030, metaverse-related commercial activities could be worth between $8 trillion and $13 trillion. The potential is vast, with virtual worlds and games poised to dominate the entertainment sector.\nKang envisions metaverse commerce evolving in unexpected ways. As developers craft novel experiences, the possibilities are endless. Walmart’s vision is an inclusive metaverse accessible via any device, ensuring it aligns with its digital values and caters to all customers.\nSafety and trust are paramount for Walmart. The company is committed to fostering digital citizenship and ensuring the creation of secure spaces for all users. Over the next year, Walmart plans to roll out more virtual world experiences.

This development has raised eyebrows and fueled speculation within the crypto community.\nStoner Cats, a brainchild of Hollywood actress Mila Kunis, has been the talk of the town lately. Kunis not only lends her voice to an animated web series that accompanies the NFT collection but also plays a pivotal role in its promotion.\nOpenSea and Blur, two leading NFT marketplaces, have adopted a cautious approach. While the collection is still visible on their platforms, they have disabled trading by discreetly concealing listings and offers under individual NFT pages. An OpenSea spokesperson clarified that Stoner Cats cannot be bought, sold, or transferred on their platform, though the collection has yet to be outright delisted.\nRarible, on the other hand, has taken a more radical stance, pulling the Stoner Cats collection entirely from public view. They reassure users that ownership remains intact, and these NFTs can still circulate freely on the blockchain or be traded on compatible marketplaces.\nThe motives behind these restrictions appear multifaceted. Regulatory concerns have cast a looming shadow over the project, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently charging Stoner Cats’ parent company with securities violations, culminating in a hefty $1 million settlement.\nIntriguingly, these market restrictions coincided with dramatic fluctuations in trading activity. DappRadar data reveals that daily trading volumes for Stoner Cats skyrocketed from negligible figures to over $6,000 and $11,000 on September 12th and 13th, only to nosedive back to near zero. Concurrently, floor prices have surged to $96, more than three times their late August and early September values.\nAlthough concerns about the sustainability of these trends may have contributed to marketplace decisions, concrete explanations still need to be discovered.

Significantly, Base outperformed its competitors, Optimism and Arbitrum, which collectively managed 878,000 transactions on the same day.\nHowever, despite this milestone, Base still trails behind more established blockchains like Polygon and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). Specifically, Polygon recorded 2.1 million transactions, while BSC boasted 3.1 million on the same day. Consequently, Base has room for growth as it aims to compete with these industry leaders.\nMoreover, the network saw a decline in daily active users compared to its previous record-setting day. According to Dune Analytics, Base had approximately 86,000 daily active users on September 14, a drop from 136,000 on August 21. Hence, user engagement is challenging while the network is scaling regarding transactions.\nAdditionally, Base has been operational since August 9, offering many services such as token bridging, swapping, liquidity provision, and NFT minting. Within a month of its launch, the network has garnered significant attention from the crypto community. For instance, more than 700,000 NFTs were minted by over 268,000 unique wallets on September 6. During its initial two weeks, the network saw over $242 million in crypto assets bridged, with daily usage from 130,000 unique wallets.\nDespite these impressive numbers, Base faces the uphill task of maintaining this momentum. The network must focus on user engagement and scalability to truly rival the likes of Polygon and BSC.\nBase’s recent achievements mark a significant step in its journey, but the road ahead is long.

    "content": "Magic Eden, a leading NFT marketplace, has announced its support for Solana’s compressed NFTs, commonly known as cNFTs. This innovative approach aims to offer a more cost-efficient and scalable alternative for digital collectible enthusiasts.\n\nUnlike traditional Solana NFTs, cNFTs have their data compressed and stored off-chain. Consequently, this makes mass production more feasible. Moreover, it dramatically reduces the fees associated with minting these digital assets. According to Magic Eden, this feature is particularly beneficial for industries like gaming, music, events, and the metaverse, where large-scale collections are common.\nAdditionally, Magic Eden believes that cNFTs could serve as an “easy access point” for newcomers to the world of digital collectibles. With lower costs, the risk associated with acquiring NFT collections diminishes, encouraging wider participation. Hence, the marketplace sees this as an opportunity to foster greater adoption of NFTs among the masses.\nSignificantly, cNFTs leverage Solana’s state compression technology. This allows for the minting of up to 1 million NFTs for approximately $110. In contrast, minting a single NFT on Ethereum can cost anywhere from $2.9 to over $30. Therefore, the cost-efficiency of cNFTs is evident.\nHowever, it’s crucial to note that hosting NFTs off-chain is not without challenges. In 2022, NFTs minted on the crypto exchange FTX faced issues when the exchange went bankrupt. The NFTs displayed blank images, leading an engineer to point out the risks of using Web2 API technology for hosting NFTs instead of blockchain. This serves as a cautionary tale for the industry.\nMagic Eden’s decision to support Solana’s cNFTs marks a noteworthy development in the NFT space. While it promises cost-efficiency and scalability, it also calls for mindful implementation to avoid potential pitfalls. As the digital collectibles market continues to mature, innovations like cNFTs could play a pivotal role in shaping its future.\n"

Moreover, over half of all Nouns NFT holders chose to depart, pulling out a staggering $27.3 million in ETH from the project’s coffers.\nOut of the 846 Nouns NFTs, 472 owners, nearly 56% of the collection, joined the fork. Additionally, they transferred a whopping 16,757 ETH from the Nouns DAO treasury to a fresh DAO organization. Hence, as a result of this fork, the original NFTs of these owners will revert to the DAO treasury.\nBesides, each holder will receive a new NFT, mirroring the original artwork, for the new DAO. This new DAO will offer holders the option to “ragequit”, allowing them to claim their share of the treasury, which is 35.5 ETH per NFT. However, they would have to relinquish their profile picture permanently.\nThe decision to fork underscores a growing disillusionment with the current Nouns DAO format. Since its inception in 2021, the project has seen millions in ETH being utilized to back various Noun-centric ventures.\nSignificantly, these ventures aimed to amplify the brand’s presence, encompassing initiatives like a 2023 Rose Parade float, vinyl toys, 3D-printed clothing, a comic series, an esports team, and more. Moreover, in a notable move, Bud Light acquired a Nouns NFT, subsequently featuring “Noun glasses” in its 2022 Super Bowl ad.\nHowever, the NFT market has declined since its peak in late 2021 and early 2022. Data from NFT Price Floor indicates that the price floor for Nouns has plummeted from a high of $267,000 in ETH in December 2021 to roughly $57,740 today.\nConsequently, while the Nouns brand may have expanded through DAO-funded projects and marketing drives, its market value has dwindled. Some members, facing a harsh bear market, seem keen to cash out and salvage some returns rather than stay with the community.\nAn anonymous NFT holder, Hindsight, commented on the fork, emphasizing the lack of acknowledgment and discussion about the reasons behind the split and potential solutions.\nThe fork became feasible due to a Nouns protocol upgrade earlier this year. It permitted NFT holders to suggest a fork, allowing them to retrieve a portion of the treasury collectively. If at least 20% of tokens, through their holders, agreed, the fork would be executed after a waiting period.\nDespite the split, the Nouns DAO retains 13,310 ETH, valued at nearly $21.7 million. NFT holders can still vote on proposals and allocate funds to nurture and bolster the brand. Seneca, a pseudonymous “Nounder” of Nouns, opined that the remaining members should intensify their efforts and utilize the treasury, emphasizing its importance in the Nouns game.\n"

    "hashtag": "NFT market",
    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has bubbled. On September 13, commissioners Mark T. Uyeda and Hester M. Peirce published a public letter opposing the SEC’s recent decision to classify Stoner Cats NFTs as unregistered securities. This decision has sparked a debate transcending mere regulatory jargon, affecting artists, creators, and the burgeoning NFT industry.\nThe SEC has officially charged the creators of Stoner Cats with selling unregistered securities linked to the launch of their Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) in 2021. According to the regulatory body, the project highlighted specific advantages of owning these digital tokens. Among these is the ability to resell them on secondary markets and earn royalties. Consequently, the SEC considers these characteristics akin to securities.\nHowever, Uyeda and Peirce beg to differ. In their counter-argument, the Republican commissioners likened the Stoner Cats sale to “fan crowdfunding.” According to them, this phenomenon is far from new and is a staple in the world of artists, creators, and entertainers.\nSignificantly, they drew parallels with the “Early Bird Certificate Packages” sold in 1977, redeemable for Star Wars character action figures and membership in the fan club. Hence, they argue that if the SEC’s Stoner Cats decision were to serve as a precedent, it should also apply to such historical fan engagement models, given that these certificates could have been resold.\nMoreover, the dissenting letter stated that the SEC’s stance “lacks any meaningful limiting principle,” implicating creators across various domains. The Stoner Cats NFTs, besides offering owners exclusive access to an animated cartoon series featuring stars like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, also allowed fans to “engage directly with the content they want to watch.” Additionally, the funds raised from the NFT sales flowed directly to the project’s team.\nIt’s worth noting that this internal discord within the SEC adds another layer of complexity to the already intricate landscape of digital assets and tokens. As regulators grapple with applying traditional legal frameworks to modern-day innovations, dissenting voices like those of Uyeda and Peirce underscore the difficulties in reaching a one-size-fits-all conclusion.\nThe public disagreement among SEC commissioners highlights the broader challenges of regulating novel asset classes. While the Stoner Cats case is far from resolved, it is undoubtedly pivotal in the ongoing dialogue about the intersection of technology, art, and regulation.\n"

    "content": "Voice, the once-promising NFT platform that underwent a dramatic pivot from a decentralized social media network, has announced its decision to wind down operations. This move comes just two years after its transformation into an NFT marketplace, signaling the challenges that the crypto and NFT markets are currently facing.\nThe journey of Voice began in 2019 when Block.one, the company behind EOS, acquired the Voice.com domain for a hefty $30 million. Initially envisioned as a groundbreaking decentralized social media platform powered by blockchain technology, Voice aimed to disrupt the traditional social media landscape. However, in January 2021, co-founder Dan Larimer parted ways with Block.one, steering his focus toward different endeavors.\n\nVoice’s shift towards NFTs was announced in 2022 by CEO Salah Zalatimo, who revealed plans to transform the platform into a hub for digital art creation, including NFTs. Despite Block.one’s substantial investment of $150 million, Voice struggled to establish itself as a significant player in the competitive NFT market, facing stiff competition from platforms like OpenSea and Rarible.\nIn a statement, Voice acknowledged the ongoing regulatory challenges within the crypto and NFT sectors but expressed its belief in the transformative potential of web3 for creators. While the company did not provide specific details regarding the wind-down process, it expressed a commitment to optimizing the transition for its community.\nAs part of its winding-down efforts, Voice intends to introduce a service that facilitates the transfer of NFTs from its platform to self-custody wallets compatible with popular public networks like Ethereum, Polygon, and EOS.\nThis development raises questions about the future of NFT platforms and the regulatory hurdles they must navigate. It also serves as a reminder of the evolving nature of the crypto space, where companies must adapt swiftly to changing circumstances or risk fading into obscurity.\n"

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has set its sights on the world of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) with a charge against the creators of the Stoner Cats project, a cartoon series intertwined with NFTs. The SEC alleges that the project sold unregistered securities during its NFT launch in 2021.\nThe Stoner Cats project, co-created and promoted by actress Mila Kunis, attracted attention for its unique approach. It offered NFTs as entrance tickets to its animated web series, allowing buyers to watch a show where cats and their owners indulge in unconventional activities.\nWhat’s particularly intriguing is that despite the regulatory crackdown, Stoner Cats NFTs are witnessing a surge in secondary market sales, with prices more than doubling since the SEC’s announcement. It’s a perplexing trend, considering that the project concluded its content production in 2022 and has been slapped with SEC charges.\nThere are several motivations at play. Some buyers might view it as a humorous or ironic investment, seeking them “for the lulz” or as cultural relics of an NFT project now under regulatory scrutiny.\n\nOthers could be banking on the newfound notoriety of Stoner Cats, hoping that these NFTs will appreciate in secondary market value. Furthermore, there’s the hope that a mechanism might emerge for refunds, as the SEC states that the project’s creators have agreed to establish a “Fair Fund” for reimbursing investors, although the details remain uncertain.\nTo put this into context, Stoner Cats NFTs initially sold for 0.35 ETH (approximately $800) each in July 2021. The project quickly raised over $8 million in just 35 minutes, and secondary market sales soared to over $20 million.\nIn response to the SEC’s enforcement action, Stoner Cats 2 LLC, the company behind the project, will pay a $1 million civil penalty without admitting fault. They have also committed to destroying any remaining NFTs and creating the Fair Fund for potential refunds.\nThe SEC’s crackdown on NFT projects involving celebrities and influencers is not an isolated incident. Earlier this year, Impact Theory, a media company led by entrepreneur Tom Bilyeu, faced a $6 million settlement and had to destroy its Founder’s Key NFT collection.\nThe SEC’s message is clear, regardless of the novelty or nature of the offering, the economic reality governs whether an investment contract falls under securities regulations. As the dust settles around Stoner Cats, it is a stark reminder of the evolving regulatory landscape in the NFT space and the potential ramifications for creators and investors.\n"

    "content": "The Milady Maker NFT collection, a prominent player in the world of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain, has fallen victim to a major exploit. The incident involved siphoning off approximately $1 million in generated fees and has sent shockwaves through the crypto community. This article delves into the details of the exploit, its repercussions, and the measures being taken to address it.\nCharlotte Fang, one of the co-founders of the Milady Maker NFT collection, took to the X platform (formerly known as Twitter) on September 11th to reveal the distressing news. According to Fang, a developer within the Milady ecosystem managed to divert a substantial sum of money, roughly $1 million, in fees that belonged to Remilia Corporation, the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) behind the Milady Maker NFT project.\n\nThe incident, which sent shockwaves through the NFT community, was tied to Bonkler, an experimental finance art project created by Remilia Corporation in April 2023. However, it’s crucial to note that the Bonkler reserves, the main contract, and the NFTs remained unscathed. Fang assured the Milady community that user assets and reserves were “perfectly safe.”\nApart from compromising the fee reserves, the attacker made a daring move by seizing control of critical code bases and coordinating efforts with other team members to take control of Remilia Corporation’s social media presence. This audacious move led to the takeover of three X accounts, including Miladymaker and Remilionaire, while locking Remiliacorp out of its accounts.\nFang issued a stern warning, urging users to consider these three compromised accounts as such until further notice. New official accounts were introduced to mitigate the damage, namely RemiliaCorp333, MiladyMaker333, and RemilioBaby.\nIn the face of adversity, Remilia Corporation swiftly identified the individuals responsible for the exploit. Fang expressed unwavering determination to pursue legal action, vowing to reclaim their property. She stated, “For such viciousness, I can give no quarter,” announcing the immediate termination of the individuals involved, who will now face the full force of the law.\nThe Milady Maker NFT collection, known for its distinctive anime profile picture NFTs, captured the attention of the crypto world when Tesla CEO Elon Musk publicly endorsed it in May 2023. Musk’s endorsement triggered a meteoric rise in the floor price of a Milady NFT, catapulting it from 3.8 Ether (ETH) to a staggering 7.8 ETH.\nThis exploit is a stark reminder of the challenges and vulnerabilities faced by NFT projects, even those with high-profile backers. The aftermath of this incident will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on the security measures and governance structures within the NFT ecosystem.\n"

Beginning October 3, every Panerai watch purchase will come with this innovative feature, a testament to the brand’s commitment to authenticity and transparency.\n\nThis move isn’t Panerai’s first foray into the world of digital authentication. In 2022, the brand introduced a similar project. The enhanced digital passport now offers detailed information about each watch, serving as a robust proof of authenticity. This initiative aims to tackle the persistent issue of counterfeit watches, ensuring confidence for buyers in the secondary market.\nWeb3 solutions provider Arianee played a pivotal role in this venture. Their partnership with Panerai has made the blockchain-backed digital passport a reality. Not just a mere certificate, this passport is transferable. It meticulously documents the watch’s technical specifics and its entire journey, from manufacture to sale. Such transparency is a boon for the secondary watch market, where authenticity is paramount.\nSpeaking of the secondary market, its scale is immense. In 2022 alone, sales of pre-owned timepieces reached a staggering $27 billion, equivalent to 25 million euros. Panerai’s digital passport offers more than just authentication. Watch owners can extend their warranty to a generous eight years, an added incentive to register their timepiece.\nPanerai’s initial collaboration with Arianee in March 2022 centered on a limited edition watch. That project highlighted the artistic and experiential facets of the brand. With the broader introduction of the digital passport, the focus has shifted to practicality. Jean Marc Pontroué, Panerai’s CEO, expressed the brand’s conviction. He believes digital identities could revolutionize how we view valuable assets.\nClaiming this digital passport is a breeze for Panerai watch owners. At the point of purchase in boutiques or by simply scanning a QR Code on the warranty card, it’s theirs. Once claimed, the passport is accessible via the Pam.Guard platform. This platform offers a plethora of benefits, creating a secure digital space for owners to chronicle their watch’s milestones.\nArianee’s influence in the luxury watch sector is undeniable. Their partnerships span brands like Breitling, L’Oreal, Moncler, and Lacoste. With the introduction of Panerai’s digital passport, the customer experience reaches new heights.

    "content": "CNA Financial, the seventh-largest commercial insurer in the United States, has taken a firm stance on non fungible tokens (NFTs) by excluding them from coverage within Schwab Strategic Trust’s substantial $20 million policy. This move, outlined in a filing submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, underscores the insurer’s cautious approach to the volatile world of digital assets.\nIn this comprehensive filing, CNA Financial explicitly states that the policy does not extend to encompass any “loss, damage, claim, occurrence, or suit related to NFTs.” The definition provided in the document describes NFTs as “unique digital identifiers connected to any digital ledger technology, which may be used to certify authenticity or ownership of anything, including but not limited to any digital, tangible, or intangible item, but cannot be substituted or exchanged for any similar item.”\nWith this exclusion firmly in place, the insurer makes it clear that losses tied to NFTs will not be covered. However, it’s important to note that the document also makes a distinction between NFTs and “cryptocurrency,” which is not included in the NFTs’ definition. This nuance reveals the insurer’s strategic approach to differentiating between various digital assets.\nNFTs experienced a meteoric rise in popularity during the bull market of 2021, attracting the attention of celebrities and corporations alike. However, the landscape has shifted since then, with NFT prices and trading volumes experiencing a sharp decline. Notably, on August 3rd, NFTs exhibited a decrease in gas usage, indicating a notable change in the market dynamics.\nDespite the waning interest in NFTs, some high-profile figures and businesses continue to explore this space. For instance, soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo announced on September 4th that he intends to release more NFTs in the future. This revelation came during a unique lie detector test, conducted to celebrate the launch of his second NFT collection in collaboration with crypto exchange Binance.\nIn addition to individual celebrities, corporate entities are also integrating NFTs into their operations. On August 31st, Lufthansa, the renowned airline, unveiled an NFT app as part of its loyalty program. This innovative app allows users to scan their boarding passes to redeem NFTs, which can, in turn, qualify passengers for enticing rewards, such as flight upgrades and access to airport lounges.\nCNA Financial’s exclusion of NFT coverage in the Schwab Strategic Trust’s policy highlights the cautious approach taken by insurers toward digital assets. While NFTs once rode a wave of hype and popularity, their fluctuating market dynamics have prompted institutions to carefully evaluate their coverage strategies, ensuring that they align with the evolving landscape of digital assets.\n"

Borget revealed that in the past year, approximately 50% of The Sandbox’s business has emanated from various Asian countries.\nBorget emphasized, “If you don’t focus on Asia, you will think the metaverse is dead from the North American and Western perspective.” He noted that Hong Kong and Korea are the leading markets in the region, closely followed by Japan.\nDuring the Asian Blockchain Gaming Alliance’s Web3 Summit in Singapore on September 12, Borget announced the impending launch of Lion City in the Sandbox metaverse. Lion City comprises 512 virtual land plots and aims to showcase Singapore’s rich culture through collaborations with global brands.\nFurthermore, Borget disclosed that The Sandbox recently concluded a significant virtual land sale in Turkey, a region he described as having a “big ecosystem.” The Sandbox ecosystem has grown substantially, boasting over 400 brands, 700 partners worldwide, and 200 verified agencies actively contributing to its development.\nDespite a slowdown in metaverse adoption in the Western world, Borget remains optimistic about new developments in the Web3 and virtual reality sectors. He highlighted the introduction of dynamic NFTs, allowing creators to modify metadata and alter the appearance and features of their assets, making each NFT truly unique.\nBorget drew a parallel with the real world, suggesting that digital assets should be as unique as tangible items with their own history and characteristics.\nAdditionally, Borget hailed Apple’s release of the Augmented Reality Vision Pro headset as a significant milestone for the metaverse industry. He praised its extended-reality features, enabling digital assets to seamlessly blend into physical environments, enhancing user interaction and immersion.\nBorget emphasized that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to driving widespread Web3 adoption in the metaverse sector.

Come September 15, 2023, the tech titan will roll out fresh guidelines for blockchain-based games featuring non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This shift is a beacon for blockchain game developers and advertisers who integrate NFTs into their game dynamics.\nThis September revision follows an initial announcement made in August 2023. The spotlight is on the promotion of NFT ads. Advertisers can now showcase these NFT games, provided they stick to specific ad criteria and steer clear of gambling-related content.\nThe updated policy paves the way for promoting NFT game-related products and services. It encompasses the marketing of in-game items. Think virtual attire for avatars, enhanced weaponry, or armor that elevates the player’s experience.\nHowever, it’s vital to underline the existing constraints. Google will stand firm on its stance against game ads that dangle the carrot of wagering or staking NFTs for winning other cryptocurrencies or NFTs. Simulated casino games rewarding NFTs and ads pushing NFT-linked “real money gambling” will remain off-limits.\nGoogle’s trajectory in cryptocurrency advertising has seen twists and turns. Rewind to 2018, and the company put a blanket ban on all crypto-related ads. The reason? Protecting consumers from potential pitfalls. Scott Spencer, the director of sustainable ads at Google, underscored the need for prudence back then.\nFast forward to 2021, and the winds changed direction. Google eased its grip, green-lighting ads from “cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets” targeting the US market. The only catch was a mandatory registration with the US FinCEN or a federal bank entity.\nThis latest easing of restrictions mirrors the surging wave of NFT gaming. The esports realm is witnessing a surge of capital, unlocking avenues previously uncharted.\nUnder this revamped policy, NFT gaming advertisers must toe the line with Google’s Gambling and games policy. They must also secure the essential Google Ads certification. A word to the wise for advertisers: stay in sync with local laws of the regions you aim to target.\nThis policy casts its net globally, covering all accounts pushing NFT-related gaming ads. Google won’t shy away from pulling up advertisers flouting the rules. Offenders will get a week’s notice to set things right. Non-compliance could lead to account freezes.\n"

This move is part of a broader restructuring effort that includes eliminating several roles within the company. Rario’s investor portfolio is not limited to Dream11; it includes global investment firm Alpha Wave Global and cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar. In a Series A funding round in April 2022, Rario secured $120 million, asserting its dominant position in cricket NFT rights with a roster of 900 cricketers.\nThe recent organizational changes are said to be influenced by Dream11’s parent company, Dream Sports, reportedly working on cost-cutting measures. TechCrunch states that Dream Sports is renegotiating many licensing agreements Rario had previously secured to reduce operational costs.\nAs of the reporting time, these changes still need to be updated on the LinkedIn profiles of the departing executives. Both Rario and Dream11 have yet to comment on the matter publicly.\nFounded in 2021, Rario had set out to create digital cricket collectibles and foster an online community for fans. By April 2021, the company reported the sale of 50,000 NFTs to sports enthusiasts in 20 different countries.\nRario had also entered into agreements with several cricket leagues, including Cricket Australia, the Australian Cricketers’ Association, the Caribbean Premier League, the Lanka Premier League, and the Abu Dhabi T10 League Legends League Cricket.\nThis shakeup at Rario comes at a time when the NFT market is experiencing rapid changes, and it remains to be seen how these executive departures and restructuring efforts will impact the platform’s future.\n"

Introduced in March, the support for Polygon NFTs was part of Binance’s plan to evolve into a multichain, open marketplace ecosystem.\nThis announcement comes amid a turbulent year for Binance, which has faced multiple challenges, including legal scrutiny. Regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) have brought charges against the exchange. Despite these setbacks, Binance has vowed to defend itself vigorously.\nAdditionally, the company has seen a series of high-profile departures. Top executives like Chief Strategy Officer Patrick Hillmann and General Counsel Han Ng have left the firm. Bloomberg also reported that several regional heads have recently exited the company. In response, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao refuted these reports in a recent post, asserting that the company has one of the lowest founding team turnovers among tech startups of its size and age.\n\nBinance’s decision to phase out support for Polygon NFTs is part of a larger trend of narrowing its focus.

Binance has also terminated its crypto card partnerships with Visa and Mastercard in certain countries.\nBinance’s NFT marketplace will continue to support three blockchains: BNB Chain, Ethereum, and Bitcoin.

Last week, a federal class-action lawsuit against basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal took a significant turn. An amended 111-page complaint has been filed, accusing O’Neal of violating securities laws related to his Solana-based NFT project, Astrals.\nLead attorney Adam Moskowitz, from The Moskowitz Law Firm, described the update as a monumental development. His firm is also leading other crypto-related class action lawsuits, including cases against Voyager and FTX. The lead plaintiff, appointed by District Judge Federico Moreno, now essentially controls the case representing all investors. This adds a fresh layer of gravity to the unfolding legal drama.\nThe new filing doubles down on the initial allegations. It includes now-deleted videos and tweets, claiming O’Neal was in frequent contact with the Astral team. Moskowitz stressed that this updated complaint offers extensive evidence of personal involvement by O’Neal, his business partners, and their sons in the Astrals project.\nAccording to the complaint, the project’s value was almost entirely dependent on O’Neal’s celebrity clout. Yet, his association with the project mysteriously waned following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX last November. The case points to O’Neal’s last post in the Astral Discord community—a GIF from “The Wolf of Wall Street,” claiming, “I’m not fucking leaving”—as a perplexing swan song.\nAs NFTs continue to straddle the line between digital assets and collector’s items, the question of legal responsibility becomes even more pressing. O’Neal’s sudden detachment from the Astrals community has left investors puzzled and looking for answers. The lawsuit marks one of the first major legal challenges against celebrity-endorsed digital assets, setting a precedent for the future of NFTs and celebrity involvement.\nThis lawsuit brings much-needed attention to the regulatory grey area surrounding NFTs and could serve as a harbinger for future legal battles in the rapidly evolving digital asset space.\n"

In a recent filing with a New York District Court, Chastain’s legal team announced the withdrawal of his application for bail pending appeal. This move aligns with the court’s previous order that mandates Chastain to self-surrender by November 2.\nAt OpenSea, Chastain wielded considerable influence. He had the power to decide which Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) would grace the marketplace’s homepage. This prime real estate can send NFT prices soaring, a fact that wasn’t lost on Chastain. Prosecutors claim he used his position to acquire 45 NFTs before spotlighting them on the platform. When their value increased, he allegedly sold them at a profit, earning over $50,000.\nChastain’s arrest in June 2022 marked a first-of-its-kind case by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice involving digital assets. Since then, he has been ordered to return his profits, which authorities have dubbed “ill-gotten gains.”\nThroughout the trial, Chastain’s lawyers argued two major points. First, they posited that the information their client used was not confidential. Second, they contested that NFTs do not qualify as securities. This argument aimed to invalidate the case altogether. However, the court remained unconvinced and allowed the case to move forward to trial.\nAllison Nichols, the prosecutor, insists that Chastain knowingly broke the law. To back this claim, she highlighted his use of anonymous OpenSea accounts to disguise his identity. Though Chastain initially faced a potential sentence of up to 20 years, the court sentenced him to a mere three months.\nThe case underscores the evolving legal landscape surrounding digital assets and insider trading. While the legal status of NFTs remains a point of contention, Chastain’s case signals that regulators are watching the digital space closely. Overall, the case serves as a cautionary tale for insiders in the rapidly growing NFT market.\n"

    "content": "In a move that significantly blurs the lines between music ownership and fan engagement, Justin Bieber has teamed up with blockchain-based music technology platform anotherblock and track co-producer Andreas Schuller, known as Axident. Scheduled for today, September 7th, they are launching a limited edition non-fungible token (NFT) for the hit song “Company.”\nAnotherblock isn’t new to such high-stakes partnerships, having previously collaborated with music giants like The Weeknd, Rihanna, and Martin Garrix. However, this initiative takes a pioneering step by offering fans a slice of the song’s streaming royalties.\n\nA total of 2,000 NFTs will be minted, and these token holders will collectively share 1% of the song’s streaming royalties. Axident, who retains the primary rights to the song, emphasized that this strategy not only enhances financial gain but deepens the emotional bond between the artist and the audience.\nMoreover, Michel Traore, co-founder and CEO of anotherblock, stated that Web3 technology plays a vital role in this project. He explained that “Company” could serve as a leading example of how NFTs could make previously inaccessible experiences available to the general public. Consequently, this venture could open up new avenues for producers like Axident, giving them the spotlight they deserve and creating a fresh revenue stream.\nBesides revenue-sharing, the initiative aims to popularize Web3 tools among music enthusiasts, contributing to the growing symbiosis between music and blockchain technology. Anotherblock’s experience in the field makes it an ideal partner for such an ambitious project, as it continues to explore and redefine the boundaries of Web3.\nAdditionally, it’s worth noting that U.S. minters will be geo-blocked due to an uncertain regulatory environment, highlighting the challenges that lie ahead for global adoption of NFTs in the music industry.\nSignificantly, “Company” originally broke into the Australian top 40 and peaked at number 53 on the U.S. charts, accumulating over half a billion streams since its debut. Hence, choosing such a high-profile song amplifies the venture’s potential impact, offering insights into how NFTs could reshape not just music ownership but also how fans interact with and financially support their favorite artists.\n"

Each of these digital assets, known as “Snoo” NFTs, is priced at $25 and limited to 500 per NFL team.\nThese NFT avatars offer football enthusiasts a unique way to showcase their team pride within Reddit’s vibrant community discussions, particularly in popular subreddits like r/NFL and r/NFCEastMemeWar. Reddit had previously introduced a free set of NFL-themed avatars during the league’s championship game in February.\n\nThe New England Patriots currently lead the pack in popularity, with 41 out of 500 NFT avatars already sold. The Chiefs and Eagles closely follow, while the Carolina Panthers and Indianapolis Colts have only seen five purchases each, according to Reddit’s shop page.\nReddit’s venture into the world of NFTs began last summer when it chose Polygon, an Ethereum scaling network known for its cost-effective and speedy transactions, as its preferred platform. Since then, Reddit has continued to expand its NFT offerings, resulting in a staggering 22 million collectible avatars minted, held by 18 million unique holders, as reported on the crypto analytics platform Dune.\nThe intersection of sports fandom and digital assets has been highlighted in surveys, such as one from Seton Hall University last year, which revealed that sports fans are twice as likely to own cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs.\nThese Reddit NFT collectibles are securely stored within users’ Vaults, which are digital wallets integrated into the Reddit mobile app. The platform has also introduced other crypto-related features, including community-specific tokens, which are all conveniently managed within the Vault.\nReddit’s latest release of NFL-themed NFT avatars offers fans an exciting way to engage with their favorite teams and communities on the platform. With the growing popularity of digital collectibles and the strong connection between sports enthusiasts and cryptocurrencies, it’s no surprise that Reddit is diving deeper into the world of NFTs, providing its users with innovative ways to express their team spirit.\n"

This time, they’ve unveiled a captivating 13-week cipher puzzle series centered around their TwelveFold Bitcoin NFT collection, which was initially introduced in February.\nThe TwelveFold collection is a captivating amalgamation of generative art, featuring a remarkable 300 unique pieces, each defined by a 12×12 grid. What sets this collection apart is its intricate use of Bitcoin ordinals, offering participants the chance to immerse themselves in the cryptic world of cryptocurrency while showcasing their puzzle-solving prowess.\n\nOver the course of the first 12 weeks, Yuga Labs will release a Moon Puzzle every week, each presenting a tantalizing challenge. The allure of these puzzles lies in the enticing reward of 0.12 BTC, translating to slightly over $3,000, awaiting those who can successfully unravel their mysteries.\nThe grand finale, set for the thirteenth week, promises an even more exclusive prize. The fastest participant to decipher this ultimate puzzle will be bestowed with a TwelveFold ordinal, a prize of considerable prestige and allure.\nWhat sets this cryptic adventure apart is the unique manner in which participants’ submissions will be recorded. Yuga Labs has chosen to immortalize these answers by inscribing them on satoshis, the smallest unit of Bitcoin.\nTo do so, participants will incur a fee ranging from $4 to $8, depending on network traffic. Additionally, a Bitcoin ordinals wallet is a prerequisite for anyone seeking to join this intellectual quest.\nIt’s important to note that only one winner can emerge from each puzzle, ensuring the utmost exclusivity and competitiveness. In the event that two individuals submit correct answers within the same Bitcoin block, the solution with the lower inscription number will prevail. Winners will receive notifications via email, cementing their place in the annals of this unique crypto puzzle challenge.\nThe journey has already begun, with the successful resolution of the first puzzle. This inaugural challenge featured six enigmatic images, seemingly depicting TwelveFold ordinals, accompanied by the cryptic clue: “Having two together during hibernation can make all the difference.” The ingenious solver deduced the answer, “Jigsaw,” by astutely recognizing that each of the images merged two ordinals, one notably blurrier than the other. Through the subtraction of the edition numbers, this enigma was masterfully unraveled, demonstrating the intellectual depth of the participants.\n"

    "content": "The Algorand Foundation has ushered in the voting phase for Period 8, Session 1. This session zeroes in on two major initiatives: the xGov Grants Program and the NFT Rewards Program. From September 1 to 15, 2023, the foundation has witnessed an impressive 575.7 million Algo staked. Moreover, 7.8K governors have stepped forward to participate.\n\nCentral to this voting session is the proposal for auto-renewal mechanisms for xGov grants. Additionally, there’s a push for a heftier allocation to the NFT rewards scheme. Early indicators reveal a robust thumbs-up from the Algorand community.\nYet, it’s not all smooth sailing for Algorand. Despite its efforts to bolster its ecosystem, its native token, $ALGO, has taken a hit. It nosedived from $3 in 2021 to a mere $0.094 recently.\nThe xGov Grants Program, currently in its pilot phase, is drawing attention. A total of 26 projects have thrown their hats in the ring. They’re vying for grants that cumulatively touch the 5 million Algo mark. The community’s goal is clear. They intend to fine-tune the xGov Minimum Viable Product (MVP).\nTo adeptly sift through and cherry-pick projects with a high impact quotient. This session also brings to the table a unique proposition. It’s about an “auto top-up” for the xGov grant allocations. This will be sourced from the available quarterly governance rewards.\nIf this sees the light of day, the mechanism will spring into action. It will kick in when the grant funds dwindle below the 1 million Algo threshold. This ensures a seamless flow of funds. As of now, this proposal enjoys a healthy 76.68% approval, as per the foundation’s records.\nOn the NFT front, the Rewards Program has made waves. Initially, a sum of 500K Algo was earmarked to energize Algorand’s NFT community. The results post its July-August 2023 launch have been noteworthy. Case in point, Rand Gallery. It reported a fourfold surge in transaction volume in just a week. Shuffl, another platform, registered a spike in listings and user activity. Algogems wasn’t far behind, doubling its monthly volume to 33K by mid-August.\nHowever, the current session’s proposal to amplify the NFT rewards program allocation has met with mixed reactions. The idea is to bump it up from 500K to 1 million Algo. But, as things stand, it’s garnered a lukewarm 42.23% approval, based on the latest data.\nThe Algorand Foundation’s latest voting session is a testament to its commitment. It’s a clear nod to expanding governance and rewarding its NFT community. Only time will tell how these proposals pan out. But one thing is certain: Algorand is on the move.\n"

OpenSea’s transaction volume on the Ethereum blockchain for August stood at a modest US$106 million. This figure marks the lowest monthly transaction volume in US dollars since May 2021. Such a decline prompts questions about the potential reasons behind this sudden drop.\nNot only did the transaction volume decrease, but the number of active users on OpenSea’s Ethereum platform also declined. With 125,000 active users in August, this is the lowest in the past year. This dwindling number of active users might indicate a shift in user preferences, or a sign of market saturation.\nOpenSea’s performance on the Polygon blockchain mirrored its Ethereum counterpart. The transaction volume for August on Polygon was US$7.02 million, marking the lowest in the past nine months. Additionally, the number of active users on the Polygon platform was 96,000, aligning with the trend observed on Ethereum.\nWhile these figures might seem alarming, viewing them in the context of the NFT market’s volatile nature is essential. OpenSea has been a dominant player in the NFT space, and such fluctuations are not uncommon in emerging markets. It remains to be seen if this is a temporary setback or a sign of changing market dynamics.\nWhile August might not have been the best month for OpenSea regarding transaction volumes and user activity, it’s crucial to remember the ever-evolving nature of the crypto space. As the industry continues to mature, platforms like OpenSea will undoubtedly face challenges, but they also present opportunities for growth and innovation.\n"

With the new AI integration, the game creation process becomes even more streamlined. Users can now generate games based on specific topics in mere minutes. This ensures that the learning material aligns perfectly with the chosen theme, making the educational experience more dynamic and engaging.\nOne of the standout features is the text-to-image tool. Recognizing the importance of visual learning, TinyTap allows users to transform textual content into visually appealing educational images. This not only enhances the graphics but also elevates the overall gameplay experience.\nThe foundation of these AI tools is robust. They draw from over ten years of data within the TinyTap ecosystem. This includes insights from over 250,000 games, millions of activities, and a staggering 170 million plays. Such a vast amount of data ensures that the AI tools are both effective and efficient.\nYogev Shelly, TinyTap’s CEO, in a conversation with CoinTelegraph, shed light on the safety and relevance of these tools. He emphasized that the AI-generated games strictly adhere to age-specific guidelines, ensuring a safe learning environment. These guidelines, as Shelly mentions, act as “governors” for the content.\nTwo primary tools bring these educational concepts to life: the aforementioned text-to-image generator and “Practice Anywhere.” The latter scours the internet for relevant content, like DIY videos or YouTube explainers, and repurposes them into educational games and content.\nShelly also highlighted the current limitation of the tools, which cater to single-topic prompts. However, he hinted at future expansions to overcome this limitation.\nDespite the potential of ed-tech, its adoption in modern academic infrastructure remains limited. Traditional classrooms often lack the dynamism that tools like those from TinyTap can offer. Yat Siu, co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca, stressed the transformative potential of technologies like AI in reshaping education for the better.\n"

Trading volumes have plummeted from a weekly high of $1.8 billion in August 2021 to a mere $73 million today.\nThe floor price of “The Merge” has dipped from 25 ether (ETH) to 1.1 ETH, reflecting a broader trend in the NFT market. While some argue that the NFT boom is over, a handful of projects remain optimistic about their potential.\nDuring a recent gathering of NFT creators, insights were shared about the ongoing projects in the NFT space, particularly in gaming, which received approximately $297 million in funding in July alone.\nOne such project is the Martian Premier League (MPL), where users can mint an MPL NFT to enter a virtual football league on Mars. Eleanor Nugent, the founder of MPL, emphasized the importance of the “ownership model” that NFTs offer, stating that it provides a compelling reason for projects to come to market. The floor price for an MPL NFT currently stands at 0.011 ETH (~$19).\nNFTs are not just confined to gaming but are also utilized for social causes. Maya Spirits, for instance, is using NFTs to champion gender equality and environmental protection in Mexico. About 70% of the proceeds from their NFTs go to donations, 20% to development initiatives, and 10% to cover travel expenses. Their NFTs are trading at a floor price of 0.015 ETH (~$26).\nWhile the NFT market has experienced a dip, its potential and adaptability remain undeterred.

The second standard is designed for tokens that can be redeemed for tangible items and experiences.\nOne of the notable features of this update is the ‘trait redemption’ facility. Unlike the traditional method of ‘burning’ a token to claim rewards, this feature allows the NFT to dynamically change its appearance when bonus content is claimed. This keeps the original NFT intact and allows for future redemptions.\nThe platform has also integrated tools that enable users to track the status of an NFT and redeem it within the OpenSea environment. Additionally, collectors will receive notifications about any outstanding claims on an NFT they purchase.\nTo showcase the capabilities of these new standards, OpenSea has initiated the ‘Burnie’ mint. Collectors can acquire a Burnie NFT egg on the Ethereum network for a nominal gas fee. Once acquired, the egg can be redeemed for a hatched token with promised future utility.\nWhile the update is ambitious, it remains to be seen how it will be received by the NFT community, especially given the recent controversies surrounding OpenSea. Nonetheless, the new features indicate a concerted effort by the platform to innovate and adapt to the evolving needs of the digital asset space.\n"

    "content": "BlueMove, a leading NFT marketplace that operates on the Aptos and Sui blockchains, has announced plans to suspend its operations on the Sei network. The decision comes into effect on August 31 at 4:00 UTC and is attributed to lower-than-expected transaction volumes. The company has urged its users to delist their NFTs during this period to safeguard their assets.\n\nLaunched in August 2022, BlueMove quickly rose to prominence in the NFT space, leveraging the capabilities of the Aptos and Sui blockchains. However, exactly a year after its inception, the platform finds itself grappling with the challenges posed by the volatile NFT market.\nThe NFT sector has seen a significant downturn recently, with trading volumes plummeting to a meager 5000 ETH over the past week—the lowest in two years. User engagement in NFT trading has also hit a two-year low, indicating a broader market trend.\nBlueMove’s struggles are not an isolated incident. In July 2023, Forbes reported significant drops in floor prices for esteemed NFT collections like CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Mutant Apes, and Azuki, with declines of up to 62% within a single month. Even major marketplaces like OpenSea, Blur, and ParaSpace are navigating through turbulent waters.\nAs the industry faces adversity, questions loom large over the future of NFTs. The current situation underscores the challenges that even well-established platforms encounter in this ever-changing landscape.\nWith declining user engagement and trading volumes, the NFT market appears to be at a crossroads. Whether this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more systemic issue remains to be seen.\nThe closure of BlueMove’s operations on the Sei network serves as a cautionary tale for the NFT market at large. It highlights the need for platforms to adapt and innovate continually to stay relevant in a market characterized by its volatility.\n"

    "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken its first enforcement action against a non-fungible token (NFT) project. The regulatory body charged Los Angeles-based podcasting studio Impact Theory for “conducting an unregistered offering of crypto asset securities.” The studio, co-founded by Tom Bilyeu, had raised approximately $30 million from hundreds of investors.\nImpact Theory is not just any podcasting studio, it is a well-known YouTube channel with over 3.7 million subscribers. The SEC’s action revolves around the studio’s offering of a “Founder’s Key” NFT, which the company promoted as an investment opportunity. According to the SEC, the NFTs sold by Impact Theory were investment contracts and therefore fell under the category of securities.\nThe SEC has ordered Impact Theory to pay $6.1 million in penalties and interest. While the company has neither admitted nor denied the SEC’s findings, it has agreed to a cease-and-desist order. Furthermore, Impact Theory will destroy all Founder’s Key NFTs in its possession and will issue a notice about this on its website and social media channels.\nThe SEC’s action has sparked a debate among its own commissioners. Republican Commissioners Hester Peirce and Mark Uyeda criticized the agency’s move, questioning the application of the Howey Test—a legal standard used to determine what constitutes an investment contract. They argued that the SEC should consider larger questions before taking additional actions in the NFT space.\nThe SEC’s action against Impact Theory marks a significant step in the regulatory landscape surrounding NFTs. It serves as a cautionary tale for other NFT projects, emphasizing the need for clarity and compliance with existing securities laws. As the regulatory framework around digital assets continues to evolve, companies venturing into this space must tread carefully to avoid similar legal pitfalls.\n"

    "content": "South Korea’s leading payment solutions provider, BC Card, has announced a initiative to revolutionize the used luxury goods market. The company has filed for two domestic patents for a unique non-fungible token (NFT) technology that aims to authenticate purchase details for secondhand luxury items.\nTraditionally, paper receipts have been the go-to method for confirming the authenticity and details of a purchase. However, BC Card aims to digitize this process by converting these receipts into NFTs. Users can simply upload a photo or file of their receipt to Paybooc, BC Card’s payment app.\nThe app then automatically converts the receipt into an NFT and stores it on the blockchain. This digital receipt can be read, sent, and received through a soon-to-be-released digital wallet by BC Card, eliminating the need for downloading the receipt from a credit card issuer’s website or app.\nThe use of blockchain technology ensures that these digital receipts cannot be counterfeited or tampered with. “Receipts registered on the blockchain eliminate the risk of loss and act as a digital guarantee,” said a source from BC Card. The company believes that this technology will be particularly useful in transactions involving secondhand high-end luxury bags, watches, and limited-edition sneakers.\nAccording to the Korea Internet and Security Agency, the domestic market for used goods in South Korea is expected to grow from 24 trillion won ($18.1 billion) in 2021 to over 30 trillion won this year. BC Card plans to leverage the payment receipt data for hyper-personalized marketing through its artificial intelligence consumption analysis.\nThe initiative by BC Card is a significant step towards modernizing the used luxury goods market and could set a precedent for other industries to follow.\n"

The investigation centers around his company, “18kRonaldinho,” which promised clients daily profits of over 2% through cryptocurrency investments.\n\nAccording to local media reports, Ronaldinho failed to appear before Brazil’s Congress for a pyramid scheme probe linked to one of his companies. The former Paris Saint-Germain, F.C Barcelona, and AC Milan star ignored a subpoena for the second time on August 24, citing adverse weather conditions as the reason for his absence.\nCongressman Aureo Ribeiro stated that Ronaldinho would have another opportunity to testify on August 31. Should he fail to appear, law enforcement officials may take him before the committee. In Brazil, witnesses who are subpoenaed to appear before Congress have a legal obligation to do so. Failure to comply may result in fines and forced appearance before Congress by the police.\nThe investigation revolves around Ronaldinho’s venture “18kRonaldinho,” which allegedly promised clients daily returns of over 2% through crypto investments. A lawsuit seeking more than $61 million in damages has been filed against the company for failing to deliver on these promises. This litigation is now part of a broader investigation into cryptocurrency frauds in the country.\nRonaldinho’s lawyers assert that he only served as the company’s “ambassador” and was, in fact, another victim of the purported scam. They claim that the company unlawfully exploited his name and likeness to mislead potential clients without his consent. In 2021, Ronaldinho also ventured into the crypto world, partnering with INFLUXO to release a non-fungible token (NFT) collection.\nThis is not Ronaldinho’s first brush with the law. In 2020, he and his brother Roberto de Assis were arrested in Paraguay for entering the country with fake passports and spent over 170 days behind bars. Assis is also involved in the ongoing crypto investigation.\n"

Mythical Games, in partnership with the National Football League and the NFL Players’ Association, developed this fantasy football Web3 mobile game. It made its first appearance in early access mode in April. By June, the game had already seen a million downloads.\nPreviously, fans could only buy these non-fungible tokens on Mythical’s online marketplace. They stored these tokens in their Mythical accounts. However, the game has now evolved. Players who reach level 4 or above in NFL Rivals can access a new option. They can click the “Improve My Roster” button on the team roster menu. This allows them to buy new player cards directly from the app.\nMoreover, to facilitate these purchases, the game introduced an in-game currency named Credits. Fans can buy Credits in various bundles. The range starts from 140 Credits for $1.99 and goes up to 7,000 Credits for $99.99.\nInterestingly, this move mirrors Stepn’s strategy. Stepn, a move-to-earn game, launched its currency for NFT purchases on its iOS app in May. However, there’s a notable difference. With Mythical, the NFT pricing remains consistent across the mobile game and web marketplace. In contrast, on Stepn, NFTs cost at least 30% more on the app, a measure to offset Apple’s fees.\nAdditionally, Mythical Games hinted at future plans in a recent blog post. They aim to introduce various in-game marketplace integrations. These will focus on enabling players to trade NFTs on both iOS and Android apps.\nThe collaboration between the NFL and Mythical Games began on March 25th, 2022. The NFL announced its intention to create an NFT-based fantasy football game. This game allows players to step into the shoes of General Managers. They can buy and sell NFT player cards, curating and competing with their dream teams. Since this announcement, the NFL’s enthusiasm for Web3 has been evident.\nSignificantly, this year’s Super Bowl showcased the NFL’s commitment to Web3. The event launched multiple Web3 experiences and features for its fans. These innovations were the top Web3 headlines from Super Bowl LVII.\n"

This spike came on the heels of a Wednesday interview with conservative commentator, Tucker Carlson. Instead of attending the GOP debate, Trump opted to criticize his rivals on Carlson’s Twitter channel, a former Fox News host.\nData from the OpenSea marketplace reveals some intriguing insights. Trading volume for Trump’s NFT cards skyrocketed by 256% within a mere 24 hours. Consequently, the volume reached a staggering 14,320 Ethereum, equivalent to $23.5 million. Moreover, the base price of these cards saw a 25% increase, settling at 0.1369 Ethereum or approximately $225.\nSales statistics from the past day are equally noteworthy. Sales surged by 220%. However, there’s a notable detail: the majority of this price hike stems from the activity of merely two wallets purchasing these NFTs. Such market movements underscore how NFT prices, akin to other digital assets, can fluctuate dramatically. For instance, earlier this month, the Ethereum NFT profile picture collection, DeGods, experienced a sharp decline. This drop occurred when a single wallet offloaded 200 of these NFTs.\nTrump, currently the GOP’s top pick for the upcoming American presidential election, introduced his NFT trading cards in December. Minted on the Polygon platform, Trump remarked that he found the artwork “sort of cute” and believed it “might sell.” The cards, showcasing illustrations of Trump in various avatars like a superhero or cowboy, initially garnered immense interest.\nHowever, buyer enthusiasm waned over time. Significantly, the card prices and trading volume seem to oscillate based on events related to Trump. This includes both positive and negative news, such as his historic indictment.\nThe world of NFTs remains as unpredictable as ever. Events, endorsements, or controversies can lead to sudden market shifts. Trump’s recent interview with Carlson serves as a testament to this ever-evolving digital landscape.\n"

Besides leading his team to a second Super Bowl victory in just six seasons, the 27-year-old has now ventured further into the world of cryptocurrency. Significantly, while many sports icons distance themselves from the volatile crypto realm, Mahomes is charting a different path.\nThis week, Mahomes announced a partnership with Azuki, a prominent name in the NFT space. Consequently, the star athlete has gone “Azuki-fied.” In layman’s terms, his image has transformed from an anime-style NFT brand into a limited edition trading card.\n\nThis unique card will be part of a series released by Azuki. Additionally, it will feature on the Museum of Mahomes, an upcoming NFT platform dedicated to the quarterback. Reports suggest that this platform plans to roll out 15,000 NFTs next month.\nHowever, the timing of this collaboration raises eyebrows. On one hand, Mahomes is enjoying unparalleled mainstream success. On the other, Azuki is recovering from a challenging summer. A series of missteps during this period put the brand’s reputation in the crypto community at risk.\nMoreover, this isn’t Mahomes’ maiden voyage into the crypto waters. In early 2021, at the peak of the NFT frenzy, he raked in a whopping $3.7 million from his digital collectibles series. Hence, his recent collaboration with Azuki isn’t just a fleeting interest but a testament to his commitment to the crypto industry.\nWhile Mahomes’ $503 million contract with the Chiefs remains the largest in NFL history, his ventures off the field are equally noteworthy. His decision to align with Azuki, especially during a critical phase for the brand, showcases his willingness to take risks.\n"

    "content": "Rarible, an NFT marketplace, has witnessed a significant surge in trading volume. This comes on the heels of a decisive public statement. The platform expressed unwavering support for NFT creator royalties, a move that seems to resonate with the community.\nSignificantly, Rarible’s trading volume skyrocketed by nearly 585% in just 24 hours. On August 23, the platform recorded over $45,000 in fiat trading volume. This uptick, as reported by analytics platform DappRadar, is noteworthy. Especially when juxtaposed against the backdrop of its competitors’ performance during the same period.\n\nHowever, it’s essential to put these numbers in perspective. While Rarible’s volume might seem modest compared to some giants in the space, its growth rate outpaces them. For instance, OpenSea and LooksRare, two major NFT marketplaces, experienced trading volume declines of 19% and 74% respectively. Moreover, X2Y2, another competitor, only managed an 8.8% increase.\nThis surge in Rarible’s volume didn’t occur in a vacuum. Alex Salnikov, Rarible’s co-founder, made a pivotal statement on August 22. He emphasized that Rarible would cease support for marketplaces that overlook royalties.\nConsequently, by September 30, Rarible intends to halt aggregating orders from OpenSea, LooksRare, and X2Y2. Salnikov’s rationale was clear. He stated, “This space is about redefining how we value and compensate creativity.” He further added, “We can’t watch the core promise of this space erode.”\nBesides Rarible’s stance, OpenSea’s decisions have also stirred the pot. In February, OpenSea decided against enforcing NFT creator royalties. This move saw them cede territory to Blur, another NFT marketplace that sidesteps royalty enforcement. Additionally, on August 17, OpenSea revealed plans to discontinue its royalty enforcement tool. \nMeanwhile, a concerning trend emerges from the broader NFT ecosystem. Royalties earned by Ethereum-based NFT projects have plummeted, hitting a two-year low in July. This data, sourced from analytics firm Nansen, underscores the challenges and evolving dynamics of the NFT space.\nThe NFT landscape shifts, marketplaces like Rarible are making their positions clear. The debate around royalties is far from over, and the coming months will undoubtedly reveal more about the future trajectory of the industry.\n"

The verdict, delivered in a federal court in New York in May, marked a significant moment as it was termed the inaugural high-profile case of insider trading within the NFT space. Chastain, aged 33, was also convicted of money laundering as part of the case.\n\nChastain’s conviction revolved around his illicit gains from trading NFTs using insider knowledge. By purchasing and selling around 45 NFTs set to be featured on OpenSea’s homepage, he managed to accrue over $50,000 in profits.\nTo obscure his transactions, Chastain employed a range of tactics including anonymous wallets and various OpenSea accounts, actions that ultimately led to his downfall, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\nSurprisingly, Chastain’s imposed sentence, amounting to only three months, was a mere fraction of the approximately two-year term that prosecutors had initially sought. The judge overseeing the case cited Chastain’s limited profits from the insider trades as a factor for the leniency in the sentence.\nNotably, during the time of Chastain’s offenses, the NFT market had reached its zenith, boasting a staggering valuation of approximately $40 billion. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, in a statement released on Monday, emphasized that the sentencing should serve as a stern caution to all corporate insiders, irrespective of the marketplace, that any form of insider trading will be met with strict consequences.\nAdditionally, Chastain’s punishment will encompass three months of home confinement post his prison term, followed by a three-year period of supervised release, as stipulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.\nThis case underscores the legal and ethical dilemmas faced within the burgeoning NFT landscape, as well as the swift response by regulatory bodies to maintain market integrity. The outcome of Chastain’s trial stands as a pivotal moment in shaping the future of NFT trading practices, and serves as a deterrent to potential wrongdoers in the industry.\n"

Additionally, the platform announced a shift to optional creator fees.\nSignificantly, OpenSea’s Operator Filter had sparked debates upon its launch in November of the previous year. The company believed the tool’s success depended on universal support from every marketplace, an objective that remained elusive.\nDespite OpenSea’s efforts, many web3 marketplaces and aggregators, including Blur, Dew, and LooksRare, found ways around the Operator Filter. Consequently, they sidestepped enforcing creator fees on their platforms.\nDevin Finzer, the co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, elucidated this trend. He noted that several platforms evaded the tool to bypass creator royalties. However, in a contrasting move post the tool’s inception, NFT marketplace X2Y2 mandated royalties for all its collections. Given recent developments, it appears X2Y2 has shifted its position. This change is evident from Rarible’s decision to stop aggregating orders from the platform.\nAlex Salnikov, Rarible’s co-founder, voiced his support for artists and creators. He emphasized the transformative potential of web3. “Web3 offers an underlying promise of hope, especially for artists and creators. This space is about redefining the paradigm in which creativity is valued and compensated,” Salnikov remarked.\nMoreover, the current tug of war over creator royalties in the NFT space highlights the complexities in balancing commercial interests with artists’ rights. The diverging moves by OpenSea and X2Y2 illustrate this dynamic tension. Rarible’s recent decision, in standing up for creator royalties, showcases their alignment with creators over profit.\nHence, as the NFT landscape continues to evolve, marketplaces are grappling with pivotal choices.

DappRadar, a renowned analytics tool, recently revealed that transactions involving Bitcoin ordinals have plummeted by a staggering 97%.\nThis nosedive, witnessed in mid-August, reflects a total of 20,571 transactions. This decline of such magnitude – a whopping 98% drop since May – bears vital implications for user engagement, which, unfortunately, has largely flown under the radar.\nDappRadar’s data release on August 17 painted a gloomy picture for the Bitcoin ordinals market. Revenues dwindled to a meager $3 million by August 14, marking a stark contrast to the pinnacle of $452 million reached in May. This alarming trend raises concerns about the prolonged viability of NFTs tied to Bitcoin.\n\nWhile DappRadar spotlighted the considerable drop in transaction count and sales volume, it also underscored the necessity of conducting further research to ascertain whether this decline is merely a temporary setback or a more systemic issue.\nThe call for more comprehensive analysis stems from the significance of the persistent drop in transaction count. This decline may mirror waning trader engagement with Bitcoin ordinals, potentially jeopardizing their relevance and endurance in the expanding realm of NFTs.\nInterestingly, this downturn follows an active second quarter marked by a notable surge in trading volumes and user involvement compared to the first quarter. The abrupt dip in Bitcoin ordinals NFT trading emerged unexpectedly, overshadowing the previously bustling quarter.\nHowever, the Bitcoin community stands divided on the role of NFTs within the network. While NFTs have seamlessly integrated into Ethereum and other blockchains, Bitcoin’s community remains polarized. Some express apprehensions about introducing NFTs to the Bitcoin network, emphasizing Bitcoin’s status as “digital gold” and a store of value.\nThe forthcoming months are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the destiny of Bitcoin-based NFTs. Observers are closely watching to discern if Bitcoin ordinals can rebound from this setback or if the coin might revert to its original role as a store of value.\n Amidst the evolving landscape of NFTs and decentralized finance, stakeholders grapple with profound uncertainties concerning the trajectory of Bitcoin-based NFTs within the realm of digital currencies.\nThe cryptocurrency sphere is navigating transformative shifts, and the fate of Bitcoin-based NFTs hangs in the balance, awaiting further developments and insights into their place in this dynamic landscape.\n"

The move comes in the wake of the challenges posed by the ongoing crypto winter. Despite boasting prominent clients like Hello Kitty and Nickelodeon, Recur’s platform is set to undergo a phased reduction in functionality, including features like NFT withdrawals, stablecoin-to-cash exchanges, and trading on Recur marketplaces over the next several months.\nThe announcement, delivered through a candid blog post, sheds light on the tough deliberations that led to Recur’s withdrawal. The company attributes unforeseen complexities and shifts in the commercial landscape as the driving forces behind this strategic pivot.\nRecur’s retreat from the NFT arena underscores the recent hardships encountered by the digital collectible sector. Approximately a year ago, Recur initiated a collaboration with Hello Kitty and Friends, aiming to craft a distinctive NFT experience. Regrettably, this joint initiative had to be shelved in the past year due to various constraints.\nRecur had observed a surge in demand for its TV Packs containing profile-picture (PFP) NFTs featuring beloved Nickelodeon characters in the previous year. However, the company now confirms that access to pack openings will be suspended by November.\nHaving emerged in 2021, Recur positioned itself as a supplier of fundamental components for Web3 applications, which other enterprises integrated into their operations. Its platform was tailored to facilitate the creation of in-game items, incentivized programs, and virtual collectibles that leverage the unique attributes of NFTs (non-fungible tokens).\nInterestingly, Recur’s fate mirrors that of another Web3 adopter, Nifty. This parallel development saw Nifty, which had formed partnerships with major media franchises like “Game of Thrones” and “The Matrix,” recently announcing its own closure.\nConsequently, these successive shutdowns within the NFT ecosystem signal the broader challenges encountered by such ventures in the present market climate. The discontinuation of these pioneering platforms casts a spotlight on the evolving dynamics of the digital collectible realm and the formidable hurdles faced by companies seeking to harness the potential of NFTs in a constantly shifting landscape.\n"

    "content": "OpenSea, a leading marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), is making strategic changes to regain its market share. Amid a significant drop in NFT trading volume, the platform has decided to limit its support for certain blockchains and revise its royalties policy.\nStarting from August 18, 2023, OpenSea users will no longer be able to create new listings or make offers on NFTs issued on BNB Smart Chain, a blockchain developed by Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. This decision was announced by the OpenSea team on its official Twitter account.\n\nHowever, OpenSea is not completely abandoning BNB Smart Chain. Users can still view, discover, and transfer BSC NFTs on the platform. The OpenSea team explained that the decision to reduce support for BSC was due to resource constraints.\nLast year, OpenSea added several chains, including BSC, in response to excitement from the wider NFT ecosystem. However, as the space evolved, the team realized that the cost of supporting BSC outweighed the impact.\nDespite this move, OpenSea remains committed to building multi-chain systems. Recently, the platform added support for Base, a novel Coinbase L2 platform on Ethereum, and Zora, an NFT-focused blockchain. Both Base and Zora are developed on OP Stack, an Optimism open-source framework.\nOpenSea was one of the first multi-blockchain marketplaces in Web3 history, supporting chains such as Optimism, Polygon, BNB Smart Chain, Arbitrum, Base, Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Klaytn, according to DappRadar.\nMoreover, OpenSea is making changes to its royalties policy. Starting from August 31, 2023, the platform will remove the Operator Filter and make royalties optional for all newly-created collections. This move is expected to provide more flexibility to creators and attract new users to the platform.\nSignificantly, amid the decline in NFT trading volume that has affected many platforms, Blur remains the only platform experiencing growth in all metrics. OpenSea’s strategic decisions come at a time when the NFT market is undergoing rapid changes, and platforms are adapting to stay competitive.\nOpenSea’s decision to limit support for BNB Smart Chain and adjust its royalties policy reflects the platform’s efforts to adapt to the evolving NFT market. By focusing on resource-efficient blockchains and offering more flexibility to creators, OpenSea aims to regain its market share and remain a leading player in the NFT space.\n"

These digital collectibles, which can be minted at no cost through the McDonald’s app, hold the promise of unlocking future exclusive benefits for their holders. A compelling chance for enthusiasts to enrich their collections with distinctive digital artifacts.\nThe brain behind this inventive move, McDonald’s Senior Director Drina Chee, underlined the sentimental significance of Grimace for devoted fans. This initiative, she emphasized, serves as a bridge between the character’s nostalgic allure and its newfound appeal for generations to come.\nTo acquire these digital treasures, users must employ a Digital Collectibles wallet through Web3auth or MetaMask. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to highlight that the redemption is constrained to a single collectible per McDonald’s account, and the trading of these collectibles remains explicitly prohibited.\nThe pool of 2,000 one-of-a-kind digital collectibles is slated to be available at no charge. Given the finite nature of these offerings, McDonald’s has issued a fervent call to fans and members to act swiftly to secure their share before stocks are depleted.\nNotably, McDonald’s Hong Kong recently embarked on an innovative partnership with The Sandbox to mark the 40th anniversary of their beloved chicken nuggets. Through an immersive metaverse playground dubbed ‘McNuggets Land,’ enthusiasts delved into the journey of Chicken McNuggets over four decades, courtesy of a virtual art gallery curated by Coach McNugget and Assistant Coach McNugget.\n"

Notably, ZachXBT took significant steps to modify his published investigative report. In doing so, he removed some of the more pointed allegations directed at Huang and adopted a milder tone for certain claims.\n\n“While the initiation of legal proceedings was regrettable, I am relieved that we managed to find a constructive way to resolve this matter,” ZachXBT conveyed on his Twitter account, expressing his perspective on the outcome.\nZachXBT also announced his intention to promptly reimburse any remaining funds contributed by supporters to finance his legal defense.\nHuang, a figure known for his roles as a Taiwanese-American musician and tech entrepreneur, had initiated the lawsuit against ZachXBT in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. The lawsuit was centered on ZachXBT’s accusations of embezzlement within the context of a crypto project named Formosa Financial, which Huang co-founded.\nZachXBT’s investigative exposé, published in June 2022, had accused Huang of misappropriating 22,000 ETH, an amount equivalent to approximately $40.7 million at the time, from the now-defunct Formosa Financial.\nIn the complaint filed for the lawsuit, Huang’s legal representation contended that ZachXBT had engaged in the “publication and malicious promotion” of false information that unjustly portrayed Huang as a criminal. The lawsuit sought reparations for the damage inflicted on Huang’s reputation.\nAcknowledging the development, Huang conveyed on Twitter that he had chosen to withdraw the defamation lawsuit in light of ZachXBT’s substantial alterations to the original article. Huang emphasized that pursuing legal action had been a last resort and acknowledged it wasn’t the most appropriate course of action.\n"

    "content": "The world’s most expensive painting, Salvator Mundi, is set to undergo a transformative journey into the digital realm. The controversial artwork, attributed to the masterful touch of Leonardo da Vinci, achieved a staggering $450.3 million at Christie’s New York auction, shattering previous records. Now, it is poised to make history again as it becomes an NFT (non-fungible token), courtesy of ElmonX, a platform specializing in digital assets.\nThe painting’s conversion to an NFT reflects a bold collaboration between ElmonX and Bridgeman Images, an international leader in image licensing. This partnership opens new avenues for high-quality NFTs, capitalizing on Bridgeman Images’ extensive collection. While the financial terms of this transformative endeavor remain confidential, sources suggest that the collaboration mirrors standard image licensing procedures.\nElmonX’s innovative approach to NFTs has already found success with iconic artworks. Notably, they released NFT versions of renowned pieces such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s Starry Night, Auguste Rodin’s The Thinker, and Claude Monet’s Nymphéas 1907.\nThese digital renditions have not only allowed art enthusiasts to own a piece of history but have also exhibited resale potential, as demonstrated by the reselling of an ElmonX artist proof Mona Lisa on OpenSea.\nHowever, the venture into NFTs is not without its challenges. The NFT market has experienced significant fluctuations, with the value of digital assets exhibiting volatility. While digital artist Beeple made headlines with a record-breaking NFT sale, the subsequent cryptocurrency crash led to an 83% drop in global NFT sales in the past year, according to NonFungible’s data.\nThis audacious move to transform Salvator Mundi into an NFT comes after a long and storied history. From its sky-high estimate of “in excess of $100 million” at Christie’s New York in 2017 to its eventual sale for $450.3 million, the painting’s journey has been nothing short of remarkable. The acquisition by the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman added intrigue, and the artwork’s current whereabouts remain shrouded in mystery.\nAs the art world witnesses this unprecedented evolution of an Old Master masterpiece, the intersection of traditional artistry and cutting-edge digital technology paves the way for an exciting and uncertain future. With its launch scheduled for August 12, the Salvator Mundi NFT is set to create waves and challenge conventional notions of artistic ownership and value in an ever-evolving landscape.\n"

This follows a tantalizing tease last month, leaving NFT holders of the Nakamigos collection on the edge of their seats. The airdrop, which is creating waves on the official NFT marketplace, is making headlines.\n\nOriginating in March 2023, Nakamigos emerged as a remarkable non-fungible token collection, consisting of a limited edition ensemble of 20,000 NFTs residing on Ethereum—a blockchain giant. Evoking a slight resemblance to CryptoPunks, the Nakamigos NFTs have etched their name in NFT history as the vanguard of short-term NFT prominence.\nThe masterminds at HiFo Labs embarked on nurturing the Nakamigos NFT concept in November 2021. The brainchild of a celebrated digital artist named Sartoshi, this project stood as a living embodiment of the NFT culture, mirroring its essence.\nHowever, a few months down the line, a twist in the narrative occurred. Sartoshi gracefully stepped aside from the venture, leaving behind a parting gift in the form of an open-edition NFT called “End of Sartoshi.” The turning point came on March 23, when Nakamigo’s NFT assortment made its foray into the NFT market, rapidly becoming a magnet for NFT aficionados and investors alike.\nThis latest maneuver by HiFo Labs doesn’t just mark another development in the NFT landscape; it embodies the synergy between innovation and anticipation, underscored by the crescendo of excitement resonating within the Nakamigos community. As the digital asset realm continues to evolve, this meticulously crafted airdrop adds another layer of significance to the NFT journey—transforming holders into participants in a nascent era of digital ownership.\nIn the midst of this evolving narrative, HiFo Labs stands as a torchbearer of inventive strides, weaving an intricate tapestry where the worlds of NFTs, blockchain, and creativity converge. As the NFT community eagerly partakes in this airdrop, it becomes evident that Nakamigos isn’t merely an NFT collection; it’s a testament to the dynamic landscape that underpins the future of digital ownership and expression.\n"

This decrease is even more significant when compared to February’s figures, which saw a staggering 89% plunge from a high of 16.2 million USD.\n\nInterestingly, the report highlights the swiftness with which stolen NFTs made their way to the market. Within a mere 165 minutes, half of the stolen NFTs were sold, predominantly through Ethereum’s leading NFT Exchange, blur. Notably, blur commanded a substantial 67.3% share, while OpenSea trailed behind with 19.63%.\nNevertheless, the NFT sector’s security woes were not unheard of. Previously, several well-known figures in the industry, including Moonbirds’ Kevin Rose, NFT.GOD investor, early Bitcoin developer Luke Dash Jr., and fund manager DeFiance Capital’s Arthur0x, had fallen victim to wallet breaches due to lax security measures.\nWhile this decline in NFT hacking incidents signifies positive progress for the market, it concurrently highlights a waning interest among users in the broader cryptocurrency domain. Transaction volume across NFT markets on Ethereum, for instance, witnessed a substantial 17% drop in July. \nThese trends signal a complex interplay between heightened security measures and shifting market sentiments. As the NFT landscape continues to evolve, stakeholders remain on the lookout for both advancements in safeguarding technologies and fluctuations in user engagement. It remains to be seen how this delicate balance will shape the future trajectory of the NFT ecosystem.\n"

    "content": "Gas consumption by non fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain has experienced a significant drop since its peak in 2021, as reported by on-chain analytics platforms. This decline signals a possible shift in NFT usage, with more users opting to hold onto their assets instead of actively trading them on marketplaces.\nData provided by Glassnode reveals that gas usage by NFT marketplaces has been on a consistent downward trend. In contrast to 2021, when NFTs dominated Ethereum’s gas usage, NFT marketplaces have seen a sharp decline in the past two years. The former top players in gas consumption, including NFT gaming project Axie Infinity and NFT marketplace OpenSea, have witnessed a substantial reduction in their gas usage.\nJumping forward to 2023, crypto analytics platform Nansen disclosed that NFT marketplaces accounted for just over 3% of the entire gas consumption during a weekly period in May. This decrease in NFT-related gas consumption coincided with a surge in Ethereum gas prices at the time. These observations have sparked theories suggesting that NFTs might have been a “product of excess liquidity” resulting from money printing during the pandemic.\n\nAs of the present, gas consumption by NFTs continues to follow a downward trajectory. Major NFT marketplaces, including Blur, OpenSea, SuperRare, LooksRare, and Rarible, now only contribute to roughly 1.85% of the entire Ethereum network’s gas consumption.\nThis trend raises questions about the underlying dynamics of the NFT market. It appears that the initial fervor and intense speculative activity that characterized the NFT landscape in 2021 have subsided. Users seem to be moving away from active trading and adopting a more passive approach to their NFT holdings.\nAs Ethereum’s gas prices remain high, it may also be a contributing factor to the decline in NFT activity on the blockchain. Higher transaction costs could deter traders and lead them to reevaluate their strategies.\nWhile the NFT market is undoubtedly evolving, it remains to be seen how this shift will impact the long-term prospects of the NFT ecosystem. As with any emerging technology, the NFT space is likely to experience periods of fluctuation and transformation. The future trajectory of gas consumption by NFTs will be closely watched by industry observers to better understand this rapidly changing landscape.\n"

This partnership offers NFT holders the opportunity to earn Etihad Guest miles, which can later be redeemed for complimentary flights, upgrades, and an array of other perks.\n\nBuilding on the success of their first NFT collection, “EY-ZERO1,” which featured intricately detailed 3D airplanes showcasing various Etihad Airways’ Boeing 787 Dreamliner liveries, this latest endeavor is set to solidify the airline’s presence in the digital realm.\nOn August 1, at precisely 3 p.m. UTC, the Etihad NFT collection will be made available to the general public through a dedicated website, with each NFT priced at $350. This move comes as a testament to the airline’s commitment to embracing the potential of blockchain technology and engaging with its audience in new and innovative ways.\nThe Etihad Airways NFT initiative is poised to make a significant impact, enhancing customer engagement, loyalty, and community involvement.

    "content": "Gucci, the renowned luxury brand under the ownership of Kering, has unveiled an exciting utility for its Gucci Material NFTs, offering token holders the chance to exchange their digital assets for premium merchandise. Partnering with the platform 10KTF.shop, Gucci enthusiasts can now redeem their NFTs for bifold wallets and exclusive Gucci x 10KTF co-branded duffle bags.\nAfter months of speculation surrounding the purpose of the 2,896 NFTs minted in March, the much-awaited reveal has finally provided a tangible benefit for token holders. To access the redemption facility, holders can head to the 10KTF.shop platform, where a single Vault Material NFT can be exchanged for a wallet, while three tokens are required to obtain the exclusive co-branded duffle bag.\nUpon closer examination, the co-branded duffle bag emerges as the more enticing deal for Gucci enthusiasts and collectors alike. A similar wallet available on Gucci’s official e-commerce site is priced at $460, whereas the co-branded duffle bag, without the 10KTF logo, commands a value of $1,790. At the popular NFT marketplace Opensea, the Gucci Material NFT is currently trading at 0.22 ETH, equivalent to approximately $412.\nThe bag’s exclusivity and co-branded appeal add a rarity value that transcends monetary measures. The Gucci Vault Material NFTs were initially rewarded to participants in a 10KTF mission within Battle Town, creating a unique “play-to-earn” or “engage-to-earn” model that encourages active participation and bridges the gap between the digital and physical worlds.\nAccording to Matt Maher, founder of technology consultancy M7 Innovations, Gucci’s strategy represents a savvy move, rewarding its community and showcasing a deep understanding of its audience.\nFor Gucci loyalists, the redemption opportunity provides a chance to own another luxury product practically for free while acting as a “trial product” to introduce Web3 enthusiasts to the world of Gucci, establishing a magnetic attraction to the brand.\nIn comparison, other luxury brands have adopted various approaches to rewarding their token holders. Louis Vuitton’s VIA program offered a limited edition Louis Vuitton trunk to purchasers of its Genesis $41,600 Treasure Trunk NFT, while Dior granted early access to an exclusive drop from Kim Jones’ Dior Men’s Spring ’24 collection to holders of its digital twin collectible, accompanying limited edition B33 sneakers.\nCollaborations between luxury brands and NFT platforms, such as Gucci’s partnership with 10KTF parent Yuga Labs and others like Tiffany \u0026 Co. with CryptoPunks and Rimowa with RTFKT, aim to bridge the gap between the digital and physical realms by leveraging exclusivity, scarcity, and rarity concepts.\nThis symbiotic relationship between Web3-native brands and traditional luxury players complements each other’s strengths, combining digital lore with physical products to create a balance that appeals to both worlds.\nGucci’s latest venture in the NFT space, coupled with its successful partnership with Christie’s in showcasing digital art talent, highlights the brand’s dedication to innovation, engagement, and embracing the potential of the metaverse. As luxury brands continue to explore the realm of NFTs and digital collectibles, the fusion of digital and physical experiences promises unique opportunities for both token holders and traditional luxury consumers.\n"

Moreover, they have expressed broader concerns regarding the potential negative implications for America’s leadership in emerging technologies due to Apple’s policies.\nThe inquiry comes amid an increasing interest in NFTs and their potential applications across various industries, from art and gaming to finance and beyond. As NFTs gain traction as a unique form of digital asset ownership, their widespread adoption and support are seen as critical factors in fostering innovation and maintaining America’s competitive edge in the technology landscape.\nThe lawmakers have carefully chosen their words, ensuring that their letter seeks information and documents from Apple to understand the precise nature of the App Store Guidelines. The absence of passive voice in their inquiry showcases their direct approach in addressing the issue.\nIt is important to note that while Apple’s strict guidelines might aim to provide a secure and controlled environment for app developers and users, concerns have arisen that these policies could inadvertently stifle emerging technologies like NFTs.\nConsequently, this could hinder American businesses and developers from fully exploring the potential of blockchain-based solutions and other distributed ledger technologies, impacting the country’s technological progress and global competitiveness.\nAs the NFT space continues to evolve, and its applications extend into various sectors, the lawmakers’ inquiry holds significant implications for the future of innovation in the United States.

    "content": "Web3 firm Suku has taken a giant leap towards mainstream crypto adoption with the launch of a groundbreaking digital wallet that leverages Twitter handles as crypto addresses. This innovative solution has already garnered massive attention, with over 48,000 downloads since its release.\nThe Suku wallet offers a seamless experience, enabling users to instantly send and receive funds via their Twitter handles, even to those who have not yet set up a wallet. By eliminating the need for complex crypto addresses, Suku aims to make Web3 more accessible to everyday internet users, without requiring prior knowledge of the crypto space. This move comes at a crucial time when crypto interest has waned due to market downturns, scandals, and bankruptcies.\nInterestingly, the company’s timing aligns with ongoing speculation about Elon Musk’s potential integration of digital currency transfers on Twitter, a social media platform immensely popular among crypto enthusiasts. If such an integration materializes, it could significantly boost crypto adoption and usage among the platform’s massive user base.\nTo demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of its tools, Suku partnered with Polygon for the launch of an “open edition NFT collection.” This collaboration allows users to mint up to 50,000 NFTs by simply posting a tweet. All they need to do is tag @0xPolygon and @SukuThis in a new tweet to initiate the minting process.\nFollowing the “tweet-minting” process, users gain access to their NFTs through a Google Chrome extension or by logging into Suku’s wallet app using their Twitter account handle. The streamlined approach provides a user-friendly experience for managing NFTs, fostering interest and participation in the burgeoning NFT market.\nSuku’s move towards integrating Twitter handles as crypto addresses represents a significant step in simplifying crypto transactions and driving web3 adoption. As crypto continues to evolve and reach a broader audience, user-friendly innovations like this will likely play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance.\nWith the growing interest in cryptocurrencies and NFTs, the success of Suku’s wallet solution and its partnership with Polygon could pave the way for more blockchain projects to leverage social media platforms for enhanced accessibility and usability.\nAs the crypto space evolves, initiatives that focus on user-friendly products and foster simplicity will be crucial in overcoming barriers to mainstream adoption. Suku’s forward-thinking approach might just be the catalyst needed to accelerate the integration of Web3 into the lives of everyday internet users.\n"

    "content": "Binance’s non fungible token (NFT) division has unveiled an AI-powered NFT generator, affectionately named “Bixel.” This revolutionary tool allows users to craft distinctive pieces of digital art using blockchain-based NFTs. The platform’s latest offering promises to usher artists and collectors alike into the captivating realm of NFTs, where unique creations are highly sought after.\n\nAs of July 26, Bixel is accessible to all customers on the Binance platform, but not without an essential safeguard. Prior to utilizing the AI NFT generator, users are required to undergo the platform’s Know Your Customer (KYC) identity verification process. This stringent measure ensures the platform remains secure and reliable for all, adhering to industry best practices and regulatory mandates.\nThe NFT creation process through Bixel comes with a nominal minting charge of 0.008 BNB, approximately $1.90 USD at present. This fee not only facilitates smooth operations but also guarantees the correct execution of the NFT minting procedure on the BNB Smart Chain.\nNotably, Binance had previously introduced a beta version of their AI NFT generator on March 1, which they playfully dubbed “Bicasso.” Surprisingly, the 10,000 available NFTs in the beta version were all snapped up in just 2.5 hours, demonstrating the immense interest and excitement surrounding this innovative tool.\nHowever, amid the excitement, Binance faced allegations of impropriety. On March 2, a user known as “Ggoma” accused the exchange of stealing their idea for a chatbot called “Chatcasso,” which had emerged victorious in the BNB Chain hackathon held in Seoul, South Korea, back in December 2022. Binance swiftly denied the claims, asserting that Bicasso had been independently developed two weeks prior to the hackathon, dispelling any rumors of wrongdoing.\nWith the launch of Bixel, Binance not only reinforces its position as a leader in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space but also opens up a world of artistic expression through AI-powered NFTs. As the platform continues to evolve, artists and enthusiasts can look forward to exploring the endless possibilities that the fusion of AI and NFTs offer in the digital art landscape.\n"

Iranian-born crypto entrepreneur Sina Estavi, who bought the tweet for a staggering $2.9 million, had hoped to sell it for a remarkable $48 million just a year later.\nHowever, the Spring 2022 auction attracted a mere 2.2 ETH bid, equivalent to $6,800, marking an incredible amount of depreciation.\nNow, the NFT’s value has plummeted even further, with the top bid standing at 1 ETH, or approximately $1,895. This represents a staggering 99.93% decline from its original purchase price, leaving many astonished at the asset’s collapse.\nDespite the disappointing turn of events, Estavi seems to be holding on to the NFT, stating that he is cautious about selling it to just anyone. “It’s important to me who wants to buy it, I will not sell this NFT to anyone because I do not think everyone deserves this NFT,” asserted the crypto entrepreneur.\nThe NFT market has faced skepticism, with some comparing it to imprudent investments and the fluctuating trends of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. While major cryptocurrencies have retained respectable value despite fluctuations, the same cannot be said for NFTs.\nGaming enthusiasts will likely recall the industry’s flirtation with NFTs, with entertainment giant Ubisoft’s Digits NFTs platform reportedly reaping a mere $396.43 in its first two weeks. Implementing NFTs in games did not prove to be worth the effort, as their value failed to impress.\nDespite the depreciation, there is a silver lining, as Estavi has pledged to donate 50% of any successful bid to charity, garnering sympathy from many. However, the future of the NFT market remains uncertain, with questions arising about its long-term sustainability and worth.\nThe fall in value of Jack Dorsey’s historic NFT has left many astounded, with bids far below the initial purchase price. Sina Estavi’s decision to hold onto the NFT, coupled with the gaming industry’s lukewarm response to NFTs, raises intriguing questions about the future of this digital collectible market.\n"

The NFTs gained widespread popularity after becoming the focal point of a viral phenomenon on Crypto Twitter.\n\nAccording to NFT Price Floor data, the lowest-priced item in the Opepen Edition collection soared to an all-time high of 0.85 ETH (equivalent to approximately $1,625) within the last 48 hours. Currently, its value remains above 0.75 ETH, amounting to nearly $1,440.\nThe term “open edition” implies that there is no limit to the number of NFTs that can be created within a specific timeframe. Initially, the minting of these pieces was free of charge, resulting in a total of 16,000 claimed NFTs.\nThe sudden surge in revenue can be attributed to a captivating occurrence that unfolded on Crypto Twitter. A friendly dispute between two influential figures in the cryptocurrency community sparked a viral frenzy, ultimately reshaping the history of Opepen Edition.\nLast week, Michael “ThreadGuy” Jerome, a prominent Crypto Twitter personality, was approached by Bored Elon, a vocal admirer of Butcher’s artwork and the largest holder of Opepen NFTs. Bored Elon proposed a trade, offering one of the earliest minted NFTs from the Opepen Edition in exchange for ThreadGuy’s prized Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFT.\n\nAlthough ThreadGuy displayed some enthusiasm about featuring an Opepen as his Twitter profile image, the trade agreement ultimately fell through.\nHowever, this seemingly minor event proved to be the catalyst for a wildfire of interest. Butcher, who had been closely following the interactions between the two influencers, was inspired to create a unique Opepen artwork specifically for ThreadGuy. The piece incorporated colors reminiscent of ThreadGuy’s Mutant Ape NFT. Overwhelmed with gratitude, ThreadGuy promptly updated his profile picture to showcase the thoughtful gift from Butcher.\nConsequently, this heartwarming gesture by Butcher, combined with the viral exchange between ThreadGuy and Bored Elon, significantly heightened the visibility and desirability of Opepen Edition NFTs. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts and collectors have taken notice, leading to a surge in demand and an unprecedented increase in the value of these digital assets.\nMoreover, the episode highlights the influential power of Crypto Twitter and its ability to propel trends within the cryptocurrency and NFT communities.

The updated filing, submitted to the Office of Government Ethics, provides a more precise account of the over $1 billion he received from various sources.\nIn his previous statement to the Federal Election Commission, Trump had been permitted to provide approximate values for certain forms of income, such as dividends and capital gains. However, the latest disclosure requires specific reporting of income from sources like salary and speaking fees.\nNotably, Trump’s earnings from his Dubai golf facility were originally reported to be between $1 million and $5 million. However, the new filing reveals that he actually earned $1,166,357 from overseeing the property.\nAdditionally, his former company, Trump Old Post Office LLC, contributed a staggering $284.5 million to his declared income, encompassing revenues from the sale of his stake in the Washington hotel and the value of furnishings and equipment.\nCritics have long raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest between Trump’s business dealings and his role as president. The latest financial disclosures, two years after leaving office, demonstrate that Trump continues to leverage his political status for financial gain. Million-dollar speaking engagements and commercial enterprises capitalize on his massive following and global brand.\nAs Trump gears up for a challenging presidential primary, this comprehensive review of his post-presidential finances provides unprecedented insight. While Democrats have criticized him for not separating his business and presidential roles, his Republican primary opponents have shown little interest in challenging his financial standing.\nThe updated public statement now includes information about CIC Digital LLC, a company benefiting from licensing payments related to non-fungible tokens featuring Trump’s image.

    "content": "In a groundbreaking move, Google Play today swung open the doors to the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in its apps and games. Consequently, developers can enable users to purchase, sell, or earn digital assets within their applications. However, this innovative step comes with strings attached: absolute transparency and adherence to Google Play’s guidelines.\nAccording to reports, the policy shift is a significant departure from Google’s erstwhile approach to blockchain-based apps. Up until recently, Google’s policies were a veritable black box. Apps like “Bitcoin Blast” were removed from the Play Store in 2021 with little explanation. Additionally, crypto mining apps faced a blanket ban in 2018, an unchanged rule.\nHowever, times have changed. Google Play has shown an evolving attitude towards Web3 technologies. In 2022, Google made room for ArDrive Mobile, an app enabling decentralized data storage, and listed Axie Infinity: Origins in selected markets. Moreover, an initiative was announced by Google Cloud in April 2023 to bolster Web3 developers and their startups.\nJoseph Mills, Google Play’s Group Product Manager, highlighted in a blog post the potential for these changes to revolutionize traditional gaming through user-owned content. He also pointed to enhancing user loyalty via exclusive NFT rewards.\nOn the same note, Reddit, a firm that has seen huge success with its Avatar NFTs, partnered with Google to formulate this new policy. Matt Williamson, Reddit’s senior engineering manager, emphasized the goal of the updated guidelines: fostering user trust and promoting responsible use of blockchain technology.\nBesides enabling more immersive user experiences, tokenized assets bring additional user protection. Nonetheless, developers are prohibited from promoting or romanticizing potential earnings from in-game activities. Hence, apps that haven’t met gambling eligibility can’t incentivize purchases of items like “loot boxes” with the chance of winning NFTs.\nIn conclusion, Google Play’s shift in policy marks a crucial milestone in adopting blockchain technology. It not only offers innovative tools for developers but also promises enriched experiences for users. Significantly, the first tests of this policy are set to roll out by late summer, as Google Play works closely with a select group of developers.\n"

On July 11, known as 7/11, the company will release free Slurpee NFTs on the Polygon network, creating a buzz among digital collectors and Slurpee enthusiasts.\nMarissa Jarratt, the Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing and Sustainability Officer at 7-Eleven, expressed her enthusiasm for this innovative celebration. She stated, “We’re always looking for new and creative ways to celebrate with our customers on our favorite day of the year.”\nTo indulge in this digital delight, customers can dive into a mobile-only candy-collecting game, where they can select from a variety of Slurpee flavors. The options include classic favorites such as Cherry, Blue Raspberry, Pina Colada, and Summertime Citrus, all presented in a virtual 7-Eleven Slurpee cup.\nJarratt hinted that customer feedback could potentially inspire new and exciting Slurpee flavors in the future. This interactive experience allows collectors to mix and match flavors to their heart’s content, creating the Slurpee of their dreams and even collaborating with their dentists to craft a healthier concoction.\n\nOnce their virtual Slurpee cup is filled to their satisfaction, collectors have the choice of claiming their “Slurpee Vibe Digital Collectible” or starting anew. If they are pleased with their creation, a simple click on “claim now” will redirect them to a page where they can provide their contact information. An email will then be sent containing a unique six-digit redemption code for their Slurpee NFT.\nTo securely store their Slurpee coins, collectors will have a new wallet created on the Polygon blockchain. This will ensure the safety and authenticity of their digital collectible.\nThe Slurpee app takes a user-friendly approach, avoiding the stigmatized term “NFTs” by referring to them as “digital collectibles.” The concept of non-fungible tokens is only mentioned in the app’s terms of service.\nIt’s important to note that the 7-Eleven ‘Find Your Slurpee Vibe’ collectibles differ from traditional NFTs. While collectors cannot sell or transfer ownership of these digital collectibles to third parties, they are granted a license to use and enjoy them in exchange for a fee.\n7-Eleven’s foray into the world of Slurpee NFTs on the Polygon network marks a significant milestone for both digital collectors and fans of the iconic frozen beverage. So, on Slurpee Day, indulge your digital cravings, unlock your Slurpee Vibe, and savor the unique experience that 7-Eleven has crafted for its customers.\n"

Within this virtual realm, holders gain access to a plethora of immersive experiences, exclusive merchandise, and influential partnerships that shape both digital and physical cultures.\nThe Aku narrative made waves in February 2021, fetching a staggering $2 million during its initial chapter sale and generating widespread attention in mainstream media.

    "content": "ZachXBT’s investigative prowess has once again made waves in the world of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), as his findings were recently cited in a Canadian class action complaint against the Boneheads group. The complaint, filed with the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in mid-June, alleges that the Blockheads group orchestrated a staggering $3.1 million rug pull involving NFTs.\n\nThe case centers around Boneheads’ purported breach of contract with investors, wherein they failed to adhere to project guidelines, misused funds, engaged in deceitful practices, and ultimately squandered the mint assets on extravagant purchases, including Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs and other luxury items. This audacious move left Simpletons NFT buyers high and dry, as the Nitwits NFT group failed to fulfill any of their promised commitments.\nZachXBT’s research played a crucial role in unraveling the intricate web of deception. On Twitter, he meticulously detailed the alleged embezzlement of funds earmarked for the Boneheads project, shedding light on the key figures involved and their swift abandonment of the endeavor when the value of the mint cryptocurrency plummeted. The detective’s incisive analysis of related tweets, which were published on July 14, 2022, and subsequent posts further bolstered the class action complaint.\n\nThis is not the first time ZachXBT’s investigative acumen has led to concrete action against unscrupulous NFT actors. In February, his protracted investigation aided the FBI in seizing 86.5 Ether and $100,000 worth of NFTs from a phishing scammer.\nLikewise, ZachXBT’s invaluable assistance earned recognition from France’s public digital unit in October 2022, when his efforts contributed to the successful apprehension and prosecution of a group of suspected phishers who had pilfered $2.5 million in NFTs.\nZachXBT’s relentless pursuit of justice in the world of NFTs has significantly impacted the industry. His work has not only shed light on fraudulent activities but has also helped compile compelling evidence against nefarious actors.\nAs regulators and law enforcement agencies continue to grapple with the challenges posed by the booming NFT market, ZachXBT’s expertise stands as a formidable asset in the fight against financial malfeasance.\nConsequently, the class action complaint fueled by ZachXBT’s research marks yet another milestone in the quest for accountability within the NFT space. With his track record of unearthing illicit schemes, it is clear that ZachXBT’s vigilance is making a tangible difference, restoring faith and protecting investors in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.\n"

    "content": "Cardano‘s NFT market performance in June outshined that of other leading blockchains, despite the network’s “ghost chain” reputation due to a decline in NFT traders, as per data from CryptoSlam. The number of unique NFT purchasers on Cardano dropped to 13,559 in June, a 10.12% decline from May and a significant drop from the peak of 254,383 in October 2021.\nHowever, despite the decrease in NFT traders, research from Forkast Labs reveals that Cardano’s NFT traders experienced lesser losses compared to Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.\nWhile traders in Cardano’s top collections suffered an estimated loss of 3.84% last month, Ethereum NFT traders likely lost around 14.41%, as indicated by the Forkast ETH NFT Composite.\nSimilarly, the Forkast SOL NFT Composite (Solana) and Forkast POL NFT Composite (Polygon) both declined by 14.71% and 13.49%, respectively. Overall, the NFT market saw a decline of 16.14% based on the Forkast 500 NFT Index.\nCardano’s native cryptocurrency, ADA, holds a market valuation of over US$10.4 billion, making it the ninth-largest cryptocurrency globally. Despite social media users referring to Cardano’s NFT ecosystem as dead, it stands as the sixth-largest blockchain for NFTs in terms of all-time trade volume, with NFT sales amounting to US$597 million.\nWhile many new startups and investors gravitate towards Ethereum and Solana, Cardano still garners support from die-hard enthusiasts and projects. Moosa Zaidi, the founder and CEO of NFT Hive Club, emphasized in an interview with Forkast that Cardano shouldn’t be dismissed as a top NFT blockchain. Zaidi noted that historical crypto portfolios demonstrate how a single market bull run can drastically alter the landscape.\nIt’s worth mentioning that most newcomers and investors who take a chance on Cardano often opt for projects outside the top 10. Despite its detractors, Cardano continues to demonstrate resilience and potential in the NFT space. As the market evolves, Cardano’s unique offerings and dedicated community could position it for a resurgence in the future.\n"

At present, buyers are unable to resell or transfer their NFTs outside of the CSX app, but the bank has revealed that it is actively working on incorporating this functionality in due course.\nThis collaboration between Credit Suisse and the Swiss Football Association represents a significant step forward for the digital asset market in Switzerland.

    "content": "Azuki, the renowned NFT platform, experienced an astounding success as it raised a staggering $38 million in a mere 15 minutes after unveiling its ecosystem expansion this Tuesday.\nThe platform had recently showcased the highly anticipated Azuki “Elementals” at an exclusive event in Las Vegas called “Follow the Rabbit,” exclusively for NFT holders. A generous gift comprising earth, fire, lightning, and water, representing the four Azuki elements, was presented to the holders among the 20,000 NFTs.\nSubsequently, the remaining NFTs were made available on Tuesday at 9 a.m. PT. Azuki NFT holders were privileged with a 10-minute window for minting before the sale, while BEANZ holders, participants in a derivative project, gained access 10 minutes later. The general public was scheduled to have access to the sale at 9:20 a.m. PT.\n\nAzuki and BEANZ holders were required to deposit 2 ETH to participate in the presale. The incredible demand resulted in the entire collection being sold out within 15 minutes, rendering a public auction unnecessary. Etherscan records indicate that the Elementals mint money wallet address amassed 20,000 ETH, equivalent to approximately $38 million.\nHowever, customers who had previously possessed Azuki or BEANZ NFTs and hoped to upgrade to an Elemental NFT expressed their disappointment over their inability to do so during the minting process. Some individuals attributed the frustration to issues with the minting platform, while others lamented the limited timeframe provided for minting.\n\nThe overwhelming response to Azuki’s ecosystem expansion reflects the growing popularity and market demand for NFTs. The rapid sell-out and substantial funds raised within a quarter of an hour demonstrate the significant interest and investment potential surrounding digital collectibles. Azuki has firmly established itself as a dominant player in the NFT space, and the success of this recent venture undoubtedly bolsters its position.\nAs the NFT market continues to evolve, it is expected that platforms like Azuki will continue to captivate both collectors and investors alike. The instantaneous success of the Elementals release serves as a testament to the incredible momentum and enthusiasm propelling the NFT industry forward. Consequently, Azuki’s achievement solidifies its standing as a significant platform in the ever-expanding world of digital art and collectibles.\n"

This series of transactions has sent shockwaves through the market, prompting discussions about the value and future of these highly sought-after digital assets.\nAccording to Blur, a prominent NFT marketplace, Huang has been involved in the movement of more than 50 Bored Ape NFTs in recent days. On Saturday, he sold an impressive 19 Apes on Blur for a staggering 651 Ethereum, equivalent to roughly $1.2 million at the time of this writing.\nThis unexpected sale has profoundly impacted the market, causing the floor price of Bored Ape NFTs to plummet to its lowest position in Ethereum value since November 2021.\nInterestingly, Bored Ape NFTs peaked in April 2022, commanding a floor price of approximately 152 Ethereum. However, as reported by NFT Price Floor, the value has steadily declined to around 33 Ethereum or $62,000 for these highly regarded “blue chip” NFTs. Despite their recent struggles, the Bored Ape Yacht Club still holds the second-highest market valuation in the NFT space, boasting a total worth exceeding $737 million.\nFortunately for Bored Ape enthusiasts, Sunday brought a glimmer of hope as Huang himself reentered the market, purchasing 14 Bored Apes for a total of 41 Ethereum, equivalent to roughly $77,000. This sudden surge of interest from Huang has had a positive effect, as NFT Price Floor reports a modest increase in the lowest-priced Bored Ape, now hovering around $74,000, representing a 14% rise from the previous day.\nInterestingly, Huang’s foray into Bored Ape NFTs was accompanied by a controversial Twitter post. He shared a photo of himself holding a shotgun, challenging users to create the “best meme” to win an Ape. While the intentions behind this post remain unclear, it has added an intriguing layer of engagement and competition within the community.\nAs the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection navigates these tumultuous waters, the market awaits with bated breath to see how this surge of activity and Huang’s involvement will shape the future of these highly coveted NFTs. Will they regain their former glory, or will their value remain in flux? Only time will tell the tale of the Bored Apes in the ever-evolving world of NFTs.\n"

    "content": "In a concerning development, the popular decentralized finance protocol, @blur_io’s Blend Protocol, has recently introduced two new EIP712 messages called “Seller” and “LoanOffer.” While these additions were intended to enhance the functionality of the protocol, security experts have discovered potential phishing exploits that could lead to significant financial losses for unsuspecting users.\n\nThe newfound vulnerabilities arise from the ability of bad actors to exploit these messages by constructing malicious loan offers or suspicious sale offers. By leveraging the seller message, an attacker could create a deceptive loan offer tied to a worthless NFT. If a user unsuspectingly signs this malicious loan offer, they will unknowingly part with their Blur ETH, resulting in the loss of their valuable assets.\n\nSimilarly, through the LoanOffer message, a malevolent actor can construct a malicious sale offer with an artificially inflated price. If an unsuspecting user signs this nefarious offer, they risk losing the NFT they had lent, falling victim to the attacker’s scheme.\n\nThese phishing exploits pose a significant threat to users of the Blur Protocol, especially those who may not be well-versed in the intricacies of decentralized finance and smart contract interactions. It is crucial for all users to exercise extreme caution and remain vigilant when engaging with these new features.\nSecurity experts and the development team at @blur_io are working diligently to address and mitigate these vulnerabilities. They are actively investigating potential solutions, including the implementation of additional security measures, audits, and user education initiatives.\nAs a precautionary measure, the Blur Protocol team advises users to carefully review and verify the details of any loan or sale offers before signing any transactions. Double-checking the terms, prices, and involved assets is essential to avoid falling victim to phishing attempts.\nIn light of these developments, the broader decentralized finance community should take note of the risks associated with new protocol features and remain proactive in identifying and addressing potential security loopholes. Collaborative efforts between developers, auditors, and users are crucial to maintaining the integrity and security of the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem.\nWhile the potential phishing exploits discovered in the Blend Protocol’s new EIP712 messages are concerning, it is essential to remember that with proper caution and awareness, users can navigate the decentralized finance landscape securely. Nonetheless, it is incumbent upon all stakeholders to prioritize security measures and promote responsible use of DeFi protocols to safeguard the community as a whole.\n"

This distinction allows AliExpress to accept cryptocurrency payments despite the Chinese government’s ban on such transactions. As part of its effort to cater to the crypto community, AliExpress even added the meme coin FLOKI to its list of supported digital assets on May 31.\nHowever, it’s essential to recognize that China has implemented strict regulations surrounding crypto transactions and has issued several warnings about the risks associated with NFT speculation.\nThe Supreme People’s Procuratorate of China, the country’s top prosecuting body, has expressed concerns regarding the lack of clear regulations and standards in the Chinese NFT market. They have emphasized the urgent need for a robust legal framework to address financial, management, network security, and legal risks related to NFTs.\nAs AliExpress forges ahead with its partnership with The Moment3, it demonstrates the platform’s commitment to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and catering to the evolving needs of its users.\nBy venturing into the Web3 space and embracing the NFT market, AliExpress continues to position itself as a trailblazer in the e-commerce industry, offering users a seamless integration between traditional online shopping and the exciting world of digital collectibles.\n"

    "hashtag": "Ethereum",
    "content": "In a surprising turn of events, renowned NFT creator ben.eth has suffered a significant financial setback due to a crucial logic error in his latest NFT contract. The oversight resulted in the unintended capping of the collection size to 9,000 tokens instead of the intended 10,000, causing him to miss approximately 100 ETH in profits.\n\nThe issue stems from a single line of code within the contract, specifically about the “maxSupply” variable. Initially set to 10,000, this variable was meant to represent the supply cap for the collection.\nHowever, upon examining line 46 of the contract, it becomes evident that the variable “available supply” determines the number of mints available to the public. Consequently, the team was allocated 1,000 mints, resulting in the “available supply” value being set to 9,000.\nThe problem escalates when examining L61 of the contract, which checks that the total number of NFTs minted is at most 10,000. Regrettably, the contract owner had already minted 1,000 NFTs immediately after deployment, increasing the “total supply” to 1,000. Due to this alteration, the maximum available supply for users was limited to 8,000 rather than the intended 9,000.\n\nThe issue arises because the cap should have been set to the original value of 10,000, given that the owner minted first. Instead, the oversight caused the collection to be capped at 9,000 tokens.\nTo rectify this issue, L61 should have been programmed to compare “totalSupply” with “maxSupply,” rather than “availableMaxSupply.” The latter variable would have been relevant only if public and owner mints coincided.\nDue to this programming error, ben.eth has experienced a substantial financial loss, missing an estimated 100 ETH in potential profits. The incident is a stark reminder of the critical importance of thorough code review and meticulous testing, especially in the rapidly evolving world of non-fungible tokens.\nWhile the error has undoubtedly been a setback for ben.eth, it also emphasizes the need for increased diligence among NFT creators and developers to ensure the integrity and functionality of their contracts.\nAs the NFT market expands, such oversights can have significant financial implications, underscoring the necessity for comprehensive quality assurance processes.\nBen.eth is expected to address the issue promptly and provide a resolution for affected users. In the meantime, this incident serves as a valuable lesson for both creators and consumers of NFTs, highlighting the importance of vigilance and due diligence in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape.\n"

    "hashtag": "NFT market",
    "content": "In a recent analysis of the SpiritDao DAOComic NFT contract, several improvements have been identified to optimize its code and significantly reduce gas costs. While the contract implemented various effective mechanisms, key areas could benefit from enhancement, including a hidden feature of ERC721A that offers substantial gas savings.\n\nThe primary recommendation for gas optimization involves removing the two mappings on L12 and 13, which are responsible for tracking the whitelist and public mint counts. Then, leveraging the power of ERC721A, a solution emerges. ERC721A already tracks the number of tokens minted by each address, and this information can be obtained by calling a specific function.\nA closer examination of ERC721A reveals an auxiliary field associated with each address, capable of storing 64 bits of additional data, making it ideal for tracking whitelist mint counts. Utilizing the aux parameter within the SpiritDao contract, whitelist mint counts can be accurately recorded. Furthermore, upon a whitelist mint event, the _setAux function can be invoked to increment the value, avoiding the need for separate mappings.\n\nThe significance of this optimization lies in eliminating a storage write operation during each mint. Storage writes are known to be one of the most expensive operations within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\nTherefore, reducing these operations results in substantial gas savings. In addition, it is worth noting that ERC721A consolidates all address-related information within a single storage slot. As a result, additional writes to this slot within the same transaction are significantly more cost-effective.\nImplementing these improvements will have a twofold impact on the SpiritDao DAOComic NFT contract. Firstly, it will streamline the contract’s codebase, making it more efficient and easier to maintain. Secondly, it will generate substantial user gas savings and incentivize further contract adoption.\nAs SpiritDao embraces these gas optimization techniques by leveraging the hidden capabilities of ERC721A, it sets a promising precedent for other projects within the NFT ecosystem.\nBy continuously seeking ways to optimize gas usage and reduce transaction costs, the broader blockchain community can pave the way for more scalable and cost-effective decentralized applications.\n"

    "content": "Pudgy Penguins has launched their Pudgy World online experience to enable users to both create and customize digital penguins through non-fungible tokens. \n\nReal toys and loot boxes are used to welcome users to NFTs without letting them know that they have any NFT. \nPreviously, to own NFTs, one had to either take part in a mint or buy them on secondary markets. However, Pudgy Penguins has a totally different approach. \nRather than making people buy NFTs, they have created a toy line that allures everyone. According to buyers of toys, they are getting a cute penguin; however, they are also getting a ticket to a digital world at the same time. \nA Polygon wallet represents each account in the Pudgy World though users can sign up through email as well as use a custodied wallet. Furthermore, every digital penguin is a SoulBound NFT.\n\nThe Pudgy team developed this SoulBound NFT contract that mints a non-fungible token to the wallet of the user while saving their penguin. It is only the Pudgy backend that can mint non-fungible tokens.\nThe Penguins can be changed to possess various colors or clothing items. An NFT represents all these customizations. \n\nTalking about how physical toys intersect with the Pudgy World, each toy has a code to redeem a loot box. Every loot box has a series of items inside and they are used to customize the penguins in Pudgy World.\n\nUpon redemption of a loot box by a user, the Pudgy backend transfers the trait NFTs to the wallet of the user without needing a MetaMask or buying crypto. As each NFT is minted ahead of time and the admin wallet owns it, only a transfer is required. \n\nThe team at Pudgy, in each flow, has hidden many scary crypto interactions to curb onboarding friction. Also, there’s a trait marketplace that lets users buy certain items with a credit card. This is one more way to decrease the friction for non crypto-native users.\n"

The team shared not being happy about card #100 was @3PEACEART instead of @6529er. Initially, the thought was to change the mint. \nIt seems as if @3PEACEART is known for its misleading behavior in the world of NFTs. They do so by telling individuals that mints were free when they were 0.25ETH and using Punk PFPs they don’t even own. Other activities they do include fake giveaways, changing accounts, engagement baits and blocking people who call them out.  \nWhen asked about this, @3PEACEART didn’t seem convincing. As a result, the planned decision is to replace it with a @6529er card. For those who are not interested in a low edition@6529er card), 6529 team will park a buy wall at 2x mint.\nMeanwhile, airdropping Card 101 to owners of Card 100 has “timing issues” concerns.  \nIt is highly expected that the account name will change again, which might push everyone to block @3PEACEART. The new @6529er card will take some time, as work needs to be done on it. Users must bid in for 50 of Card #100 at 0.135ETH. This will remain until changes are made. \n"

    "content": "Earlier this month, Blur released Blend, an NFT perpetual lending protocol, as reported by Today NFT News. The move has made Blur stronger than thought other than hitting a new milestone. \nAccording to Dune’s data, within only 17 days of its launch, Blend has eased a total volume of more than 100,000 ETH, which is almost $181 million. \nBlend allows users to take Ethereum loans in exchange for putting their non-fungible tokens as collateral. The loan can then be used to buy new NFTs on Blur. By doing so, liquidity providers get interest, i.e. a process that has generated the “NFTfi” niche in crypto.\nThe project got more than 3,000 loans from 900 exclusive lenders. Adding BAYC and MAYC collections on May 15 ignited the passion a step ahead among NFT collectors. \nThese collections were added to the previously available collections- Wrapped Cryptopunks, Miladys, Azuki and DeGods.\nOn day one, both BAYC and MAYC accumulated a total volume of 2,267 ETH. BAYC became the third-most traded collection on Wednesday with a volume of 3,082 ETH. \nAzuki is the leading collection in total volume that has gone beyond 50,000 ETH, which signifies almost half of the total volume ever since the service was made.\nBlend doesn’t charge fees from both lenders and borrowers. However, Blur has hinted that token owners could vote to impose fees after a period of 180 days. Representing 59% of the overall NFT transaction volume till date, the marketplace has gained popularity quite early. \nFor some, Blur is the promoter of wash trading operations, specifically amid the token launch of the platform. \nAccording to Hildhobby, an analyst, Blur accounted for 14,575 traders only as compared to 46,353 on Opensea.\nDuring February’s end, CryptoSlam announced eliminating Blur trades worth $577 million from its data owing to market manipulation. Furthermore, the platform said that it will filter future Blur trades via an updated algorithm that will exclude doubtful sales.\nThere’s no denying that Blend’s access will drive success for Blur, which already seems to be establishing itself as a key player in the NFT space.\n"

    "content": "The highest national agency in China has cautioned that NFT digital collections have the characteristics of virtual assets that the country has banned. \nPublishing its own guidelines for the treatment of non-fungible tokens, the Supreme People’s Procuratorate of the People’s Republic of China suggested intense “risk research and judgment” so as to punish crimes in an accurate way. \nIn 2021, China not only cracked down on local crypto but also stopped banks from providing crypto-based services. This led to the disappearance of the local industry until NFTs entered the picture and began gaining fame in the country as digital collectibles that were different from high-risk crypto. However, the recent post by the prosecution agency warns otherwise.\nAccording to the report, despite their high popularity, they can lead to risks associated with network security, finances, management, and more, specifically legal risks. Prosecutors are taking the matter quite seriously. \nNFTs have an exclusive digital identifier for physical or virtual items that enables recording the proof of ownership on a blockchain. China’s prosecution agency believes that holders can’t enjoy ownership, especially of digital art, which can be both replicated and distributed.\nOne author of the report said that, from a property rights point of view, consumers don’t cherish the ownership of the purchased NFT digital assets in terms of civil law. Also, they can’t forbid others from replicating, accessing, or distributing the digital assets mapped by NFT. All they enjoy includes an exclusive right to prevent others from interfering in the ownership of the NFT that’s recorded on the blockchain.\nThough China is reluctant about crypto, it is interested in making the most of the blockchain technology that supports virtual assets to expand its national digital infrastructure. Recently, the country launched its own central bank digital currency, which has been quite impactful too. \nThe prosecution agency said that as a new application of blockchain, NFT has the potential for specific development. On that note, it remains unclear whether China will ban NFTs or regulate them in a controlled way.\n"

However, holders must collect the complete set, which will bridge the gap between the real and digital realms.\nCelebrating the unofficial Star Wars holiday on May 4, Mattel partnered with OnChain Studios to launch Cryptoys, a collection of Star Wars-based digital collectibles. The NFTs were also powered by Flow and were available for $39.99.\nOther than the Fast \u0026 Furious NFT collection, Flow is known for hosting several other leading NFT collections, such as NFL All Day, Dapper Labs’ UFC Strike NFT platform, and NBA Top Shot.\nMattel announced the release of its Hot Wheels NFT collection, Series 4, last December.

    "content": "Visualize Value founder and the artist behind the Checks VV NFT collection, Jack Butcher, is launching Checks Elements, a new project that combines generative artwork with hand-drawn physical prints.\nChecks Elements includes a 152-piece generative art collection inspired by the four elements- water, earth, air, and fire. Every art is an exclusive, algorithmically-generated composite of colors that not only creates these elements but also probes the dynamic relationship between consensus and truth.\nButcher shared that elements are theoretically the most basic example of decentralized consensus. He added that they are trying to apply the themes that Checks aims to express regarding consensus on the internet to pre-internet consensus. This means that all different cultures, parts of the world, languages, and various perspectives landed on the four elements of water, earth, air, and fire.\nThe team altered the algorithm that formed the original Checks collection as well as added certain new parameters to make the new collection. Butcher partnered with Jean Robert Milant and Cirrus Editions to instill life into the NFT outputs and convert them into hand-drawn 30-inch by 43-inch monoprints created through an on-chain SVG file fed via a vintage lithographic printing press.\nThe physical prints were created by engraving the signature on a four-by-four check grid adjacent to a plate used by the printer. Every color in the collection was added one after another on the basis of algorithmic outputs made by Butcher and his team. This was followed by authenticating each physical artwork by using Butcher’s fingerprint and combining it with an Ethereum-backed NFT. \nButcher continued that converting checks into physical artwork never felt like something was continuing the project’s DNA until they had spoken to Milant to gain an understanding of the process. The way such prints come from a set of limitations is similar to how they are changed later on the basis of rules generated by a computer. \nOn May 16, three elements- air, water, and earth will be offered at an auction at Christie’s. A part of the funds from the sale will be donated to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.\nThe physical work and its digital counterparts will then be displayed at Christie’s New York gallery starting May 20. The fourth element, i.e., fire, will be offered through public auction for 24 hours. On June 24, the physical prints will begin shipping.\nThe auction will use “some of the dynamics” that were used in the original Checks collections; however, this project won’t certainly be interoperable with other gamified pieces. \nTalking about the previous Checks collection that was inspired by Twitter’s popularized blue verification check mark, owners are able to composite non-fungible tokens to make smaller and exclusive editions of checkmarks. \nA few things will be carried over when the remaining collection will be offered at auction after Christie’s and this will not run as a traditional and ordinary auction. Though there are many mechanics, the idea of elements for the long term is to exist as pairs that complement the current checks space. \nCollectors may wish to disconnect their physical prints from their non-fungible tokens to sell them separately; however, they will want to keep them together for provenance purposes. \nPresident of Beyond Art Creative Martin Klipp, who helped to make the artwork a possibility, said making a deliberate choice to not include a burn mechanism into this thing. He believes that both pieces are art and were twinned. Also, they have their advantages and exist together or separate. \n"

Substantive examination marks the next step followed by granting or dismissing legal safety to the invention. \nLG’s application claims that its technology enables devices to connect with a cryptocurrency wallet as well as an NFT market server to allow transactions. After being linked to an NFT market server, the device includes onscreen QR codes to enable users to fulfill transactions through a crypto wallet. \nThe application follows the launch of LG Art Lab Marketplace, LG’s NFT platform launched  in September 2022. The platform is based on the Hedera network and supports webOS 5.0 or later versions for the purpose of trading digital artworks. \nAt the moment, it isn’t disclosed whether the TV will be incorporated with several wallets or would be limited to the firm’s smartphone cryptocurrency wallet Wallypto, which is available on the Art Lab Marketplace.\nThe company is enrolling many Web3 solutions on its devices. For instance, in January, LG revealed a collaboration with Oorbit and Pixelynx, cloud-dependent technology platforms, to take the metaverse directly into the living rooms of viewers. The partnership aimed at enabling customers to explore interrelated virtual concerts, worlds and AI multiplayer games via their LG TVs. \nIn the beginning of 2023, LG took forward its metaverse plans when it launched the Blade Wallet, which allows NFT trading upon connecting to LG Art Lab. \nOther than LG, Samsung has also followed the path of incorporating Web3 into its products. In 2022, the company announced a new smart TV lineup incorporated with an NFT platform.

In a nutshell, the coin serves no purpose beyond entertainment. \nHowever, investors believe that LADYS includes more than just meme value. Currently, the overall market capitalization of the token has increased by more than $140 million, with a 24-hour trading volume of $230 million. \nThe official website of the token mentions that LADYS’ entire supply is 888 trillion. The website also states that 94% of the tokens were sent to the liquidity pool. Moreover, LP tokens were burned, and the contract was rejected. \nThe token was available only on Uniswap until earlier this week. However, several crypto exchanges listed it on May 11; thereby, adding to its popularity. Furthermore, Bybit even offered LADYS prize pools to stimulate deposits. On the other hand, other exchanges, such as Bitget, are sticking to the meme aspect of LADYS and supporting its listing decision. \nMilady’s recent tweet clarified that LADYS is the tokenization of the completely optimized white pill.
